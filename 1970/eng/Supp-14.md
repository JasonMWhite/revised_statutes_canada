to which it belongs.

in the preliminary list for any polling divi
sion, the returning officer shall prepare the

ing day at the polling station for which

guilty of an illegal practice and of an
offence against this Act.

  * (_a_) no payment and no advance or
deposit shall be made before, during or

for any small expense legally incurred
by him, if no part of the sum so paid is
repaid to him.
(6) Every person who makes any pay
ment, advance or deposit in contravention
of subsection (4) , or pays in contravention
thereof any money so provided is guilty of
an illegal practice and of an offence
against this Act.
(7) A contract whereby any expenses
are incurred on account of or in respect of
the conduct or management of an election
is not enforceable against a candidate
unless made by the candidate himself or by
his official agent or by a sub-agent of the
official agent thereto authorized in writing,
but inability to enforce the contract
against the candidate does not relieve him
from the consequences of any corrupt or
illegal practice having been committed by
his agent.
(8) Every payment made by or through
an official agent in respect of any expenses
incurred on account of or in respect of
the conduct or management of an election
shall, except where less than twenty-five

subsection, the legal representative of the
person shall send in the bill, charge or

probate or letters of administration, or of
his becoming otherwise able to act as legal
representative and, if he does not do so,
the right to recover the bill, charge or
claim or any part thereof shall be barred.
(12) All expenses incurred by or on
behalf of a candidate on account of or in
respect of the conduct or management of
an election shall be paid within fifty days
after the day on which the candidate re
turned was declared elected, and not other
wise and, subject to such exception as may
be allowed pursuant to this Act, an official
agent who makes a payment in contra
vention of this provision is guilty of an
illegal practice and of an offence against
this Act.
(13) Notwithstanding anything in this
sect i n where cause is at time shown
&amp;gt; any
to the satisfaction of a judge competent
to recount the votes given at the election,
that judge, on application by the claimant
or by the candidate or his official agent,
may, by order, give leave for the payment
time in this section mentioned for sending
in claims, or although sent in to the candi
date and not to the official agent.
(14) Where an election court reports
that it has been proved by a candidate
that any payment made by an official agent
in contravention of this section was made
without the sanction or connivance of
such candidate, the election of such can

any incapacity by reason only of such
payment having been made in contra
vention of this section.

of any claim sent in to him within the
time limited by this Act, disputes it or
refuses or fails to pay it within the period

fit, bring an action to recover the claim
in any competent court.
(16) Any sum paid by the candidate or
his agent pursuant to a judgment or order
of a court made in respect of an action
brought pursuant to subsection (15) shall
be deemed to be paid within the time
limited by this Act and to be an exception
to the provisions of this Act requiring
claims to be paid by the official agent.
(17) A candidate may pay any personal
expenses incurred by him on account of or
in connection with or incidental to an
election to an amount not exceeding two
thousand dollars, but any further personal

and, in that case, shall forthwith be trans
mitted to the returning officer.
(12) The delay authorized by subsection
(11) in the making of a declaration by a
candidate does not exonerate his official

the return and declaration respecting elec

agent.
(13) Where, after the date on which a
re (; Urn respecting election expenses is trans-

(14) Where the return and declarations
respecting election expenses of a candidate
at an election have not been transmitted
as required by this Act or, having been
transmitted, contain some error or false
statement, then,
  * (_a_) if the candidate applies to a judge
competent to recount the votes given at
the election and shows that the failure
to transmit such return and declarations
or any of them, or any part thereof, or
any error or false statement therein, has
arisen by reason of his illness, or of the
absence, death, illness or misconduct of
his official agent or of any clerk or officer
of such agent, or by reason of inadvert
ence or of any reasonable cause of a like
nature, and not by reason of any want
of good faith on the part of the appli
cant, or
  * (_b_) if the official agent of the candidate
applies to the judge and shows that the
failure to transmit the return and dec
larations that he was required to trans
mit, or any part thereof, or any error
or false statement therein, arose by rea
son of his illness or of the death or
illness of any prior official agent of the
candidate, or of the absence, death, ill
ness or misconduct of his clerk or officer
of an official agent of the candidate, or
by reason of inadvertence or of any
reasonable cause of a like nature, and
not by reason of any want of good faith
on the part of the applicant,
the judge may, after such notice of the
application in the electoral district and on
production of such evidence of the grounds
stated in the application and of the good
faith of the application, and otherwise as
to the judge seems fit, make such order for
allowing an authorized excuse for the fail
ure to transmit such return and declaration,
or for an error or false statement in such
return and declaration, as to the judge
seems just.
(15) Where it appears to a judge on
hearing an application pursuant to sub
section (14), that
  * (_a_) in the case of an application by
a candidate, the candidate is unable to
comply with the provisions of this Act
respecting the return and declarations
as to his election expenses by reason
of the refusal or failure of his official
agent or preceding official agent to make
such return or supply such particulars
as would enable the return and declara
tion to be made, or
  * (_b_) in the case of an application by
an official agent, the official agent is
unable to comply with the provisions
of this Act respecting the return and
declarations as to the election expenses
of the candidate for whom he is the
official agent by reason of the refusal
or failure of a preceding official agent
to make such return or supply such
particulars as would enable the return
and declaration to be made,
the judge shall, by order in writing served
personally on the person who so refused or
failed to make a return or supply particu
lars, direct that person to attend before
the judge and, on that person s attendance,
shall, unless the person shows cause to the
contrary, order him to
  * (_c_) make such return and declaration
or supply such statement of the par
ticulars required to be contained in the
return, as to the judge seems just, and
make or supply them within such time
and to such person and in such manner
as the judge may direct, or
  * (_d_) be examined with respect to such
particulars,
and if the person so ordered does not
comply with the order to attend or an
order referred to in paragraph (c) or (d)
he is guilty of an offence against this Act.
(16) An order made pursuant to sub
section (14) may provide that an allow
ance of an authorized excuse is conditional
upon the making of a return and declara
tion in a modified form or within an ex
tended time and upon the compliance with
such other conditions as to the judge
seem best calculated for carrying into effect
the objects of this Act.
(17) An order allowing an authorized
excuse relieves the applicant for the order
from any liability or consequence under
this or any other Act in respect of the
matters excused by the order and, where it
is proved by the candidate to the judge
that any act or omission of the official
agent of the candidate in relation to the
return and declaration respecting election
expenses was without the sanction or con
nivance of the candidate and that the
(18) Where an order is made pursuant
to subsection (14), the date of the order
or i if the order specifies that conditions
are to be complied with, the date on which
the applicant fully complies with them,
shall for the purposes of this section be
deemed to be the date of the allowance
of the excuse.
