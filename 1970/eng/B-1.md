capital is lost, the directors shall, if all the

amount equal to the amount of the loss or
the amount of the subscription price of the
stock remaining unpaid, whichever is the
lesser.

the Minister the amount of any loss to which
this section refers and the calls, if any, made

an instalment or call upon his shares of the

in accordance with the by-laws or a resolution
of the directors, the directors may, by
resolution, declare forfeited the shares in
respect of which the payment is in default.
(2) Shares declared forfeited under subsec
tion (1) become, by such declaration, the
property of the bank, and the directors shall,
before the expiry of six months from the
declaration, sell them to such persons, in such
and on such terms as they may
determine.
(3) Notwithstanding the forfeiture of shares
under this section, the shareholder who
immediately prior to the forfeiture was the
holder of the shares, continues to be liable to
the bank for the amount of the subscription
price of the shares that was unpaid at the
time of forfeiture, less such amounts as are
subsequently received by the bank in respect
of the shares. 1966-67, c. 87, s. 42.

**43.** In any action brought to recover any
money due on any instalment or call, it is not
necessary to set forth the special matter in
the declaration or statement of claim, but it
is sufficient to allege that the defendant is
the holder of one share or more, as the case
may be, of the capital stock of the bank, and
that he is indebted to the bank for instalments
or calls upon such share or shares, in the sum
to which the instalments or calls amount, as
the case may be, stating the amount and
number of the instalments or calls, and it is
not necessary, in any such action, to prove
the appointment of the directors. 1966-67, c.
87, s. 43.

one register of transfers in Canada.

and any register of transfers and the making
of entries therein. 1966-67, c. 87, s. 45.

no transfer of shares of the capital stock of
the bank is valid unless
  * (_a_) it is made in a register of transfers of
the bank, and

required by the bank, previously discharged
all his debts and liabilities to the bank that
exceed in amount the then market value of
the remaining shares, if any, belonging to
such person. 1966-67, c. 87, s. 46.

**47.** (1) Unless under the by-laws of the
bank it is unnecessary that transfers of shares
of its capital stock be made in the books of
the bank, all sales or transfers of shares, and
all contracts and agreements in respect thereof,
made or purporting to be made, are void if
the person making the sale or transfer, or the
person in whose name or on whose behalf the
sale or transfer is made, at the time of the
sale or transfer
  * (_a_) is not the registered owner in the books
of the bank of the share or shares so sold or
transferred, or intended or purporting to be
sold or transferred, or
  * (_b_) has not the registered owner s assent to

and remedies, under any contract of
sale that does not comply with the conditions
and requirements mentioned in that subsec
tion, of any purchaser who has no knowledge
of the non-compliance. 1966-67, c. 87, s. 47.

**48.** (1) Where under the by-laws of the
bank it is unnecessary that transfers of shares
of its capital stock be made in the books of
the bank, no transfer of shares is, until it has
been duly recorded in a register of transfers
of the bank, valid for any purpose whatever,
save only as exhibiting the rights of the
parties thereto toward each other, and, if
absolute, of rendering any transferee jointly
and severally liable with the transferor to the
bank and its creditors.
(2) Notwithstanding subsection (1), the
delivery of a certificate for fully paid shares
the transfer of which need not be made in the
books of the bank, with a duly executed
transfer endorsed thereon or delivered there
with, constitutes a valid transfer of the shares
comprised therein, if the shares are listed on
any recognized stock exchange at the time of
the delivery, but, until the transfer of the
shares has been duly recorded in a register of
transfers of the bank, the bank shall treat the
registered holder of the shares as being solely
entitled to receive notice of and to vote at
meetings of shareholders and to receive any
payment in respect of the shares whether by
way of dividend or otherwise. 1966-67, c. 87,
s. 48.

**49.** (1) When a share of the capital stock
of the bank has been sold under a writ of
execution or under the decree, order or
judgment of a court, the transfer of the share
from the registered holder thereof to the
purchaser at the sale shall be recorded in a
register of transfers of the bank but only after
receipt by the bank of an attested copy of the
writ, decree, order or judgment bearing a
certificate signed by the officer who conducted
the sale certifying to whom the sale was made,
or other evidence satisfactory to the bank of
the sale and the identity of the purchaser,
and after the discharge of all debts and
liabilities to the bank of the registered holder
of the share and of all liens thereon in favour
of the bank and, where under the by-laws of
bank it is unnecessary that transfers of
of its capital stock be made in the
of the bank, after surrender to the bank
the certificate for the share.
(2) Where it is necessary that transfers of
shar6S f ltS CE P ital St ck be made in the
books of the bank, a transfer recorded in
accordance with subsection (1) shall have the
same effect as though it were a valid transfer
made in the books of the bank by the
registered holder of the share. 1966-67, c. 87,
s. 49.

**50.** (1) Where the transmission of a share
^ * ne capital stock of the bank takes place
by operation of law otherwise than because of
the death of a shareholder, the bank shall be
furnished with an affidavit or declaration in
writing in form satisfactory to it signed by or
on behalf of a person claiming under the
transmission stating the nature and effect of
the transmission together with any corrobora
tive evidence that the bank may request, and
where under the by-laws of the bank it is
unnecessary that transfers of shares of its
capital stock be made in the books of the
bank, with the certificate for the share, and
thereupon the transmission shall be recorded
in a register of transfers of the bank.

person claiming a share by virtue thereof is
entitled to receive notice of or vote at
meetings of shareholders or to receive any
payment in respect of the share whether by
way of dividend or otherwise. 1966-67, c. 87,
s. 50.
5 1. (1) Where the transmission of a share
of the capital stock of the bank takes place
because of the death of a shareholder, the

in form satisfactory to the bank, signed by
or on behalf of a person claiming by virtue
of the transmission, stating the nature and
effect of the transmission,
  * (_b_) when the claim is based on
  * (_i_) a will or other testamentary instrument
or on a grant of probate thereof or on
such a grant and letters testamentary or
other document of like import or on a
grant of letters of administration or other
document of like import, purporting to
be issued by any court or authority in
Canada or elsewhere, of an authenticated
copy or certificate thereof under the seal
of the court or authority without proof of
the authenticity of the seal or other proof,
or
  * (_ii_) a notarial will, of an authenticated
copy thereof, and
  * (_c_) if under the by-laws of the bank it is
unnecessary that transfers of shares of its
capital stock be made in the books of the
bank, of the certificate for the share,
is sufficient justification and authority for
paying any dividend and for recording and
giving effect to the transmission in accordance
with the claim ; but nothing in this subsection
shall be construed to prevent the bank from
refusing to record or give effect to a
transmission until there has been delivered to
the bank such documentary or other evidence
of or in connection with the transmission as
it may deem requisite.

in a register of transfers of the bank, no

the security was acquired without knowledge
on the part of the bank of such lien.
(5) The rights and powers of the bank do
not have priority over an interest or right
acquired in, on or in respect of the property
covered by security given under this section

proper land registry or land titles or other
office to whom a document mentioned in

register or file the document according to the
ordinary procedure for registering or filing

this subsection does not apply if the provincial
law does not permit such registration or filing
of the tendered document.

security provided for by this section, the bank
may take, on any property covered by the
security, any further security it sees fit.

that security, to the extent of the quantity
covered by the security taken, any security
covering or entitling it to the delivery of the
hydrocarbons or hydrocarbons of the
or a similar grade or kind. 1966-67, c. 87,
