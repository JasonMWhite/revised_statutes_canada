Necessary Allégations in Proceedings

**139.** (1) In describing offences respecting
the sale or other unlawful disposai of
intoxicating liquor, or the keeping thereof for
sale, in any information, summons, conviction,
warrant or proceeding under the Tempérance
Act of 1864, or under this Act, it is sufficient
to State the unlawful sale, barter, disposai or
keeping of intoxicating liquor simply, without
stating the name or kind of such liquor, or
the price thereof, or the name of any person
to whom it was sold, bartered or disposed of ;
and it is not necessary to state the quantity
of liquor so sold, bartered, disposed of or kept,
except in the case of offences where the
quantity is essential, and it is then sufficient
to allège the sale or disposai of more or less
than such quantity.
(2) It is not necessary, in any such summons,
conviction, warrant or proceeding, to négative
the circumstances, the existence of which
would make the act complained of lawful, but
upon any such circumstances being proved in
évidence, the défendant shall be acquitted.
(3) The provision of subsection (2) as to
manner of statement of an offence applies,
whether such circumstances are stated by way
of exception in the section under which the
offence is laid, or in a substantive section, or
otherwise. R.S., c. 30, s. 139.
Proof

**140.** When in any house, shop, room or
place in any county or city in which
Part II or in which any prohibitory by-Iaw
passed under the Tempérance Act of 1864, is
in force, a bar, counter, béer pumps, kegs, or
any other appliances or préparations similar
to those usually found in taverns and shops
where intoxicating liquors are usually sold or
trafficked in, are found, and intoxicating
liquor is also found in such house, shop, room
or place, such liquor shall be deemed to hâve
been kept for sale contrary to Part II or the
Tempérance Act of 1864, as the case may be,
unless the contrary is proved by the défendant
in any prosecution ; and the occupant of such
house, shop, room or other place shall be
taken conclusively to be the person who keeps
therein such liquor for sale. R.S., c. 30, s. 140.

**141.** In proving the sale or barter or other
unlawful disposai of liquor for the purpose of
any proceeding relative to any offence under
the Tempérance Act of 1864, or under this Act,
it is not necessary to show that any money
actually passed or that any liquor was actually
consumed, if the justices, magistrale or other
officer or court hearing the case is satisfied
that a transaction, in the nature of a sale or
barter or other unlawful disposai, actually
took place. R.S., c. 30, s. 141.

**142.** In any prosecution under the Tem-
pérance Act of 1864, or under this Act, for the
sale or barter or other unlawful disposai of
intoxicating liquor, it is not necessary that
any witness should dépose directly to the
précise description of the liquor sold or
bartered, or the précise considération therefor,
or to the fact of the sale or other disposai
having taken place, with his participation or
to his own personal and certain knowledge;
but the justices or magistrate or other officer
trying the case, so soon as it appears to them
or him that the circumstances in évidence
sufficiently establish the violation of law
complained of , shall put the défendant on his
defence, and in default of his rebuttal of such
évidence, shall convict him accordingly. R.S.,
c. 30, s. 142.

**143.** On the trial of any proceeding, matter
or question under the Tempérance Act of 1864,
or under this Act, the person opposing or
defending, or the wife or husband of such
person opposing or defending, is compétent
to give évidence in such proceeding, matter
or question. R.S., c. 30, s. 143.
Subséquent Offences

**144.** (1) In case of a previous conviction
or convictions being charged,
  * (_a_) the justices or magistrate or other officer
shall, in the first instance, inquire concern-
ing such subséquent offence only, and if
the accused is found guilty thereof, and is
présent when so found guilty, he shall then,
and not before, be asked whether he was so
previously convicted, as alleged in the
information, and, if he answers that he was
so previously convicted, he may be convicted
accordingly, but, if he dénies that he was
so previously convicted or stands mute of
malice, or does not answer directly to such
question, or is not présent when found
guilty as aforesaid, the justices or police
magistrate or other officer shall then inquire
concerning such previous conviction or
convictions ;
  * (_b_) the number of such previous convictions
shall be provable by the production of a
certificate under the hand of the convicting
justices or magistrate, or officer, or of the
clerk of the peace, without proof of signature
or officiai character, or by other satisfactory
évidence ;
  * (_c_) a conviction may, in any case be had as
for a first offence, notwithstanding that
there has been a prior conviction or
convictions for the same or any other
offence.
(2) Convictions for several offences may be
made under this Act, although such offences
hâve been committed on the same day ; but
the increased penalty or punishment herein-
before imposed is only recoverable or liable
to be imposed in the case of offences
committed on différent days, and after
information laid for a first offence. R.S., c.
30, s. 144.

**145.** In the event of any conviction for
any second or subséquent offence becoming
void or defective after the making thereof, by
reason of any previous conviction being set
aside, quashed or otherwise rendered void,
the justices or magistrate or other officer by
whom such second or subséquent conviction
was made, may, by summons under his or
their hand, require the person convicted to
appear at a time and place to be named in
such summons, and may thereupon, upon
proof of the due service of such summons, if
such person fails to appear, or on his
appearance, amend such second or subséquent
conviction, and adjudge such penalty or
punishment as might hâve been adjudged
had such previous conviction never existed,
and such amended conviction shall thereupon
be deemed valid, to ail intents and purposes,
as if it had been made in the first instance.
R.S., c. 30, s. 145.
Variances, Defects and Amendments

**146.** In the event of any variance between
the information and évidence adduced in
support thereof, the justices or magistrate or
other officer may amend or alter such
information, and may substitute, for the
offence charged therein, any other offence
against the Tempérance Act of 1864, or of this
Act, as the case may be ; but if it appears that
the défendant has been materially misled by
such variance, such justices, magistrate or
other officer shall thereupon adjourn the
hearing of the case to a future day, unless the
défendant waives such adjournment. R.S., c.
30, s. 146.

**147.** No conviction or warrant enforcing
the same, or other process or proceeding under
either of the said Acts shall be held insuf f icient
or invalid by reason of any variance between
the information and conviction, or by reason
of any other defect in form or substance, if it
can be understood from such conviction,
warrant, process or proceeding, that the same
was made for an offence against some
provision of such Act, within the jurisdiction
évidence to prove such offence, and if no
greater penalty is imposed than is authorized
by such Act, and the court or judge, where so
satisfied, shall, even if the punishment
imposed or the order made is in excess of that
which might lawfully hâve been imposed or
made, hâve the like powers in ail respects to
deal with the case as seems just as are by the
Criminal Code conferred upon the court to
which an appeal from any summary conviction
or order had or made before any justice is
taken under the provisions of the Criminal
Code relating to summary convictions. R.S.,
c. 30, s. 147.

**148.** (1) Upon any application to quash
^"^" i conviction • .• or Warrant ^ enforcmg f • the ^l same,
or other process or proceeding, or to discharge
any person in custody under such warrant,
whether such application is made in appeal
or upon habeas corpus, or otherwise, the court
or judge to whom such appeal is made, or to
whom such application is made in appeal or
upon habeas corpxis, or otherwise, shall dispose
of such appeal or application upon the merits,
notwithstanding any such variance or defect
as aforesaid.
(2) Such court or judge may, in any case,
amend any such conviction or warrant, process
or proceeding, if necessary.
(3) In ail cases in which it appears that the
merits hâve been tried and that any conviction,
warrant, process or proceeding is sufficient
and valid under this section or otherwise, such
conviction, warrant, process or proceeding
shall be affirmed, or shall not be quashed, as
the case may be ; and any conviction, warrant,
process or proceeding so affirmed, or affirmed
and amended, may be enforced in the same
manner as convictions affirmed on appeal,
and the costs thereof are recoverable as if
originally awarded. R.S., c. 30, s. 148.
