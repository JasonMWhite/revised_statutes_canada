## SCHEDULE
International Convention for the Régulation of Whaling
The Governments whose duly authorized représentatives hâve
hereto,
Recognizing the interest of the nations of the world in
for future générations the great natural resources
represented b3' the whale stocks;
Considering that the history of whaling has seen overfishing
of one area after another and of one species of whale after
another to such a degree that it is essential to protect ail species
of whales from further overfishing ;
Recognizing that the whale stocks are susceptible of natural
increases if whaling is properly regulated, and that increases in
the size of whale stocks will permit increases in the numbers of
whales which may be captured without endangering thèse
natural resources ;
Recognizing that it is in the common interest to achieve the
optimum level of whale stocks as rapidly as possible without
causing wide-spread économie and nutritional distress ;
Recognizing that in the course of achieving thèse objectives,
whaling opérations should be confined to those species best able
to sustain exploitation in order to give an inter\'al for recovery
to certain species of whales now depleted in numbers ;
Desiring to establish a system of international régulation for
the whale fisheries to ensure proper and effective conservation
and development of whale stocks on the basis of the principles
embodied in the provisions of the International Agreement for
the Régulation of Whaling signed in London on June 8, 1937
and the protocols to that Agreement signed in London on June
24, 1938 and November 26, 1945; and
