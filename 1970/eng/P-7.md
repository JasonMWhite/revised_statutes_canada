grant of such pension, and

of the Commission, be awarded a pension at
a rate not exceeding the rate provided in

although there is no evidence that she had
been publicly represented by him as his wife.
(5) A woman who has been divorced,
judicially separated or separated pursuant to
a written or other agreement from a member
of the forces who has died is not entitled to
pension unless she was awarded alimony or

allowance under the terms of the separation
agreement, in which case she is entitled, if
she is in a dependent condition, to the
equivalent of the widow s pension, or the
equivalent of the alimony or alimentary
allowance that she was awarded or the
allowance to which she is entitled under the
terms of the separation agreement, whichever
is the smaller in amount ; except that where
that amount is smaller than the widow s
pension it may, in the discretion of the
Commission, be increased to an amount not
exceeding that provided in Schedule B for a
widow.

woman has been divorced, judicially separated
or separated pursuant to a written or other
agreement from a member of the forces who
has died, and such woman is in a dependent
condition, the Commission may, in its
discretion, award a pension at a rate not
exceeding the rate provided in Schedule B
for a widow, although such woman has not
been awarded alimony or an alimentary
allowance or is not entitled to an allowance
under the terms of the separation agreement,
if, in the opinion of the Commission, she
would have been entitled to an award of
alimony or an alimentary or other allowance
had she made application therefor under due
process of law.
(7) The Commission may, in its discretion,
refuse to award a pension to a widow of a
member of the forces who, at the time he

that resulted in his death, or

grant of such pension, and
  * (_i_) his death occurred one year or more
after the date of the marriage, or
