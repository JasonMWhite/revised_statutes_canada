the absence of other provisions in that
behalf in the letters patent or supple
mentary letters patent, at all meetings
of shareholders every shareholder is en
titled to give one vote for each share
then held by him, but no shareholder in
arrears in respect of any call is entitled
to vote at any meeting.

**105.** (1) The directors of a company
by resolution, fix a record date for
determining the shareholders who will be
entitled to vote at meetings of sharehold
ers, which record date shall not be more
than thirty days before the date of the
meeting of shareholders.
(2) A notice of the record date fixed
under subsection (1) shall be given, at
least fourteen days before the record date
so fixed,
  * (_a_) to each shareholder, in the manner
required by subsection (3) for the
giving of the notice of the time and
place for holding a meeting of share
holders, and

paper in the location where the com
pany has its head office and each loca
tion in Canada where it has a transfer
agent, and

holding any meeting of shareholders
shall be given by sending the notice to
each shareholder entitled to vote at the

wrapper or letter, not less than fourteen
days or more than sixty days before the
date of the meeting, to his latest address
as shown on the books of the company.
(4) Notice of the time and place for
holding any meeting of shareholders
need not be given
  * (_a_) to persons who were not registered
on the books of the company on the
record date fixed under subsection (1) ;
or
(6) if all the shareholders of the com
pany entitled to vote at the meeting
waive notice of the meeting in writ
ing.
(5) Where a company has not fixed a
record date under subsection (1), the
failure of any shareholder of the com
pany to receive a notice of the time and
place for holding a meeting of share-
holders of the company does not deprive
the shareholder of a vote at the meet
ing if the shareholder is registered on
the books of the company at least forty-
eight hours, excluding Saturdays and
holidays, before the time set for the
meeting.
(6) In the absence of other provisions
in that behalf in this Act, the letters
patent or supplementary letters patent,
all questions proposed for the considera
tion of the shareholders at any meeting
of shareholders shall be determined by
the majority of votes, and the chairman

ing any provision of the letters patent or
supplementary letters patent of the
company except in respect of a meeting
of a company for which a notice of the
time and place thereof has been given to
the shareholders before or on the date
this section comes into force."

strained-class shall not be voted at any
meeting of the company.
(5) If a provision of this section is con
travened at a general meeting of the share
holders of a company, no proceeding, mat
ter or thing at that meeting is void by
reason only of such contravention, but any
such proceeding, matter or thing is, at any
time within twelve months from the day of
commencement of the general meeting at
which the contravention occurred, voidable
at the option of the directors of the com
pany by a by-law duly passed by the direc
tors and sanctioned by two-thirds of the
votes cast at a special general meeting of
the shareholders called for the purpose.

or recorded in the register of the com
pany or desiring to subscribe for a share
of the company to submit such declara
tion as may be required pursuant to this
section in the case of a shareholder; and
  * (_c_) providing for the determination of
the circumstances in which any declara
tions shall be required, their form and
the times at which they are to be sub
mitted.
(2) Where pursuant to any by-law made
under subsection (1) any declaration is re
quired to be submitted by any shareholder
or person in respect of the transfer of or
subscription for any share, the directors
may refuse to allow such transfer to be
made or recorded in the register of the com
pany or to accept such subscription until
a declaration satisfactory to the directors
has been submitted to them.
(3) In determining for the purposes of
these statutory provisions whether a person
is or is not a resident or a Canadian,
whether an individual is a Canadian citi
zen, whether a is directly or
submitted under these provisions or rely
upon the knowledge of any of the directors
of such circumstances; and the company,
directors, officers, employees or agents are
not liable in any action for anything done
or omitted by them in good faith as a result
of any conclusions made by them on the
basis of any such statements or knowledge.
(4) Where, for any of the purposes of
these provisions, the directors require to
establish the total number of voting shares
of the company held by non-residents, the
directors may calculate the total number of
such shares held by non-residents to be the
total of
  * (_a_) the number of voting shares held by
all shareholders whose recorded addresses
are places outside Canada; and
  * (_b_) the number of voting shares held by
all shareholders whose recorded addresses
are places within Canada but who, to the
knowledge of the directors, are non
residents ;

a date not earlier than the prescribed day
or four months before the day on which the
calculation is made, whichever is the later
date.
(5) Where by any calculation made
un der subsection (4) the total number of
voting shares held by non-residents is equal
to or less than the gross prescribed per
centage for the company, the number of
voting shares, the transfer of which by resi
dents to non-residents the directors may
allow to be made or recorded in the register
of the company, shall be so limited as not
to increase the total number of voting
shares held by non-residents to more than
gross prescribed percentage.
(6) Notwithstanding section 2 of these
provisions, where in the case of a transfer
of any shares of the company to a trans
feree it appears that
  * (_a_) the total par value of voting shares,
or the total number of voting shares, of
the company held by the transferee as
shown by the register of the company at
a date not more than four months earlier
is not more than the value or number
specified for the purpose in the letters
patent or supplementary letters patent
by which the company became a con
strained-share company, and
  * (_b_) the total par value of voting shares,
or total number of voting shares, of the
company included in the transfer and
any voting shares acquired by the trans
feree after the date mentioned in para
graph (a) and still held by him as shown
by the register of the company is not
more than the value or number specified
for the purpose in the letters patent or
supplementary letters patent by which
the company became a constrained-share
company,
the directors are entitled to assume that the
transferee is not and will not be associated
with any member of the constrained-class
and, unless the knowledge of the directors
is to the contrary, that he is not a member
of the constrained-class.

**7.** (1) Notwithstanding section 2 or 3 of
these provisions, where it is necessary for
a constrained-share company to reduce the
total percentage of its voting shares or of
any class of its voting shares, held by or
for members of the constrained-class after
the prescribed day for either of the pur
constrained-share company held by or for
members of the constrained-class exceeded
gross prescribed percentage for the com
pany, the directors, so long as the total
number of voting shares held by or for all
members of the constrained-class exceeds
the gross prescribed percentage,
  * (_a_) shall refuse to allow a transfer of
a voting share of the company to a mem
ber of the constrained-class to be made
or recorded in the register of the com
pany; and
  * (_b_) shall not accept a subscription for
a voting share of the company by a
member of the constrained-class.
(2) Where at the commencement of the
prescribed day the number of voting shares
of the company held by or for a member of
the constrained-class exceeded the net pre
scribed percentage for the company, the
voting rights pertaining to the shares held
by or for that member may, notwithstand
ing section 5 of these provisions, be exer
cised, in person or by proxy, so long as the
percentage of such shares held by or for
such member does not exceed either the
percentage of such shares held by or for
him at the commencement of the prescribed
day or the smallest percentage of such
shares held by or for him on any subse
quent day ; but this subsection shall not be
construed to prohibit the exercise of voting
rights in circumstances where section 5 of
these provisions does not apply."

attaching to each class whether with

attend and vote at general meetings on
any question directly affecting any of
the rights or privileges attached to such
