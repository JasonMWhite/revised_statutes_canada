## SCHEDULE
(Original)
of Agreement of af the the In International Development
Association
The Governments on whose behalf this Agreement is signed,
Considering :
That mutual cooperation for constructive economic purposes,
healthy development of the world economy and balanced growth
of international trade foster international relationships condu
cive to the maintenance of peace and world prosperity ;
That an acceleration of economic development which will
promote higher standards of living and economic and social
progress in the less-developed countries is desirable not only in
the interests of those countries but also in the interests of the
international community as a whole ;
That achievement of these objectives would be facilitated by
an increase in the international flow of capital, public and
private, to assist in the development of the resources of the less-
developed countries,
do hereby agree as follows :
Introductory Article
The International Development Association (hereinafter called
"the Association") is established and shall operate in accordance
with the following provisions:
Article I
Purposes
The purposes of the Association are to promote economic
development, increase productivity and thus raise standards of
living in the less-developed areas of the world included within
the Association s membership, in particular by providing finance
to meet their important developmental requirements on terms
which are more flexible and bear less heavily on the balance of
payments than those of conventional loans, thereby furthering
the developmental objectives of the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (hereinafter called "the Bank")
and supplementing its activities.
The Association shall be guided in all its decisions by the
provisions of this Article.
Article II
Membership ; Initial Subscriptions
Section 1. Membership

  * (_c_) Ten percent of the initial subscription of each original
member shall be payable in gold or freely convertible currency
as follows: fifty percent within thirty days after the date on
which the Association shall begin operations pursuant to Article
XI, Section 4, or on the date on which the original member
becomes a member, whichever shall be later ; twelve and one-
half percent one year after the beginning of operations of the
Association; and twelve and one-half percent each year
thereafter at annual intervals until the ten percent portion of
the initial subscription shall have been paid in full.
  * (_d_) The remaining ninety percent of the initial subscription
of each original member shall be payable in gold or freely
convertible currency in the case of members listed in Part I of
Schedule A, and in the currency of the subscribing member in
the case of members listed in Part II of Schedule A. This ninety
percent portion of initial subscriptions of original members shall
be payable in five equal annual instalments as follows : the first
such instalment within thirty days after the date on which the
Association shall begin operations pursuant to Article XI,
Section 4, or on the date on which the original member becomes
a member, whichever shall be later; the second instalment one
year after the beginning of operations of the Association, and
succeeding instalments each year thereafter at annual intervals
until the ninety percent portion of the initial subscription shall
have been paid in full.
  * (_e_) The Association shall accept from any member, in place
of any part of the member s currency paid in or payable by the
member under the preceding subsection (d) or under Section 2

member or the depository designated by such member, which
shall be non-negotiable, non-interest-bearing and payable at
their par value on demand to the account of the Association in
the designated depository.
  * (_f_) For the purposes of this Agreement the Association shall
regard as "freely convertible currency":
  * (_i_) currency of a member which the Association determines,
after consultation with the International Monetary Fund,
is adequately convertible into the currencies of other
members for the purposes of the Association s operations;
or
  * (_ii_) currency of a member which such member agrees, on
terms satisfactory to the Association, to exchange for the
currencies of other members for the purposes of the
Association s operations.
  * (_g_) Except as the Association may otherwise agree, each
member listed in Part I of Schedule A shall maintain, in respect
of its currency paid in by it as freely convertible currency
pursuant to subsection (d) of this Section, the same convertibility
as existed at the time of payment.
  * (_h_) The conditions on which the initial subscriptions of
members other than original members may be made, and the
and the terms of payment thereof, shall be determined
the Association pursuant to Section 1(6) of this Article.

**3.** Limitation on Liability

Section 1. Additional Subscriptions
  * (_a_) The Association shall at such time as it deems appropriate
in the light of the schedule for completion of payments on
initial subscriptions of original members, and at intervals of
approximately five years thereafter, review the adequacy of its
resources and, if it deems desirable, shall authorize a general
increase in subscriptions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, general
or individual increases in subscriptions may be authorized at
any time, provided that an individual increase shall be
considered only at the request of the member involved.
Subscriptions pursuant to this Section are herein referred to as
additional subscriptions.
(6) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (c) below, when
additional subscriptions are authorized, the amounts authorized
for subscription and the terms and conditions relating thereto
shall be as determined by the Association.
  * (_c_) When any additional subscription is authorized, each
member shall be given an opportunity to subscribe, under such
conditions as shall be reasonably determined by the Association,
an amount which will enable it to maintain its relative voting
power, but no member shall be obligated to subscribe.
  * (_d_) All decisions under this Section shall be made by a two-
thirds majority of the total voting power.
Section 2. Supplementary Resources Provided by a Member in the
Currency of Another Member
  * (_a_) The Association may enter into arrangements, on such
terms and conditions consistent with the provisions of this
Agreement as may be agreed upon, to receive from any member,
in addition to the amounts payable by such member on account
of its initial or any additional subscription, supplementary
resources in the currency of another member, provided that the
Association shall not enter into any such arrangement unless
the Association is satisfied that the member whose currency is
involved agrees to the use of such currency as supplementary
resources and to the terms and conditions governing such use.
The arrangements under which any such resources are received
may include provisions regarding the disposition of earnings on
the resources and regarding the disposition of the resources in
the event that the member providing them ceases to be a
member or the Association permanently suspends its operations.
(6) The Association shall deliver to the contributing member
a Special Development Certificate setting forth the amount and
currency of the resources so contributed and the terms and
conditions of the arrangement relating to such resources. A
Special Development Certificate shall not carry any voting

accepting resources from a member in its own currency on such
as may be agreed upon.

member, and currency of such member derived therefrom as
principal, interest or other charges, may be used by the
Association for administrative expenses incurred by the
Association in the territories of such member and, insofar as
consistent with sound monetary policies, in payment for goods
and services produced in the territories of such member and
required for projects financed by the Association and located in
such territories ; and in addition when and to the extent justified
by the economic and financial situation of the member concerned
as determined by agreement between the member and the
Association, such currency shall be freely convertible or otherwise
usable for projects financed by the Association and located
outside the territories of the member.
(6) The usability of currencies received by the Association in
payment of subscriptions other than initial subscriptions of
original members, and currencies derived therefrom as principal,
interest or other charges, shall be governed by the terms and
conditions on which such subscriptions are authorized.
  * (_c_) The usability of currencies received by the Association as
supplementary resources other than subscriptions, and currencies
derived therefrom as principal, interest or other charges, shall
be governed by the terms of the arrangements pursuant to which
such currencies are received.
  * (_d_) All other currencies received by the Association may be
freely used and exchanged by the Association and shall not be
subject to any restriction by the member whose currency is used
or exchanged ; provided that the foregoing shall not preclude
the Association from entering into any arrangements with the
member in whose territories any project financed by the
Association is located restricting the use by the Association of
such member s currency received as principal, interest or other
charges in connection with such financing.
  * (_e_) The Association shall take appropriate steps to ensure
that, over reasonable intervals of time, the portions of the
subscriptions paid under Article II, Section 2(d) by members
listed in Part I of Schedule A shall be used by the Association

such portions of such subscriptions as are paid in gold or in a
currency other than that of the subscribing member may be used
more rapidly.
Section 2. Maintenance of Value of Currency Holdings
  * (_a_) Whenever the par value of a member s currency is reduced
or the foreign exchange value of a member s currency has, in
the opinion of the Association, depreciated to a significant
extent within that member s territories, the member shall pay to
the Association within a reasonable time an additional amount
of its own currency sufficient to maintain the value, as of the
time of subscription, of the amount of the currency of such
member paid in to the Association by the member under Article
II, Section 2(&amp;lt;f), and currency furnished under the provisions of
the present paragraph, whether or not such currency is held in
the form of notes accepted pursuant to Article II, Section 2(e),
provided, however, that the foregoing shall apply only so long
as and to the extent that such currency shall not have been
initially disbursed or exchanged for the currency of another
member.
  * (_b_) Whenever the par value of a member s currency is
increased, or the foreign exchange value of a member s currency
has, in the opinion of the Association, appreciated to a
significant extent within that member s territories, the Associa
tion shall return to such member within a reasonable time an
amount of that member s currency equal to the increase in the
value of the amount of such currency to which the provisions of
paragraph (a) of this Section are applicable.
  * (_c_) The provisions of the preceding paragraphs may be waived
by the Association when a uniform proportionate change in the
par value of the currencies of all its members is made by the
International Monetary Fund.
  * (_d_) Amounts furnished under the provisions of paragraph (a)
of this Section to maintain the value of any currency shall be
convertible and usable to the same extent as such currency.

undertaken by it to the Association, whether as a member,
borrower, guarantor or otherwise.
(6) When a government ceases to be a member, the Association
and the government shall proceed to a settlement of accounts.
As part of such settlement of accounts, the Association and the
government may agree on the amounts to be paid to the
government on account of its subscription and on the time and
currencies of payment. The term "subscription" when used in

this Article be deemed to include both the initial subscription
and any additional subscription of such member government.
  * (_c_) If no such agreement is reached within six months from
the date when the government ceased to be a member, or such
other time as may be agreed upon by the Association and the
government, the following provisions shall apply:
  * (_i_) The government shall be relieved of any further liability
to the Association on account of its subscription, except that

Association are needed by it to meet its commitments as of
that date under its financing operations,

paid in by the government on account of its subscription or
derived therefrom as principal repayments and held by the
Association on the date when the government ceased to be

rata share of all principal repayments received by the
Association after the date on which the government ceases

total amount paid by all members on account of their
subscriptions which shall have been used or in the opinion
of the Association will be needed by it to meet its
commitments under its financing operations as of the date
on which the government ceases to be a member. Such
payment by the Association shall be made in instalments

Association, but not more frequently than annually. Such
instalments shall be paid in the currencies received by the
Association except that the Association may in its discretion
make payment in the currency of the government concerned,

subscription may be withheld so long as that government,
or the government of any territory included within its
membership, or any political subdivision or any agency of
any of the foregoing remains liable, as borrower or guarantor,
to the Association, and such amount may, at the option of
the Association, be applied against any such liability as it
matures.

paragraph (c) an amount exceeding, in the aggregate, the
lesser of the two following: (a) the amount paid by the
government on account of its subscription, or (6) such

government ceased to be a member, as the amount of its
subscription shall bear to the aggregate amount of the
subscriptions of all members.

such basis as shall be reasonably determined by the
Association.

this Section be paid until six months after the date upon which
the government ceases to be a member. If within six months of

Association suspends operations under Section 5 of this Article,
all rights of such government shall be determined by the
provisions of such Section 5 and such government shall be
considered a member of the Association for purposes of such
Section 5, except that it shall have no voting rights.

incident to the orderly realization, conservation and preservation
its assets and settlement of its obligations. Until final
settlement of such obligations and distribution of such assets,
the Association shall remain in existence and all mutual rights
and obligations of the Association and its members under this
Agreement shall continue unimpaired, except that no member
shall be suspended or shall withdraw and that no distribution
shall be made to members except as in this Section provided.
(6) No distribution shall be made to members on account of
their subscriptions until all liabilities to creditors shall have
been discharged or provided for and until the Board of
Governors, by vote of a majority of the Governors exercising a
majority of the total voting power, shall have decided to make
such distribution.
  * (_c_) Subject to the foregoing, and to any special arrangements
for the disposition of supplementary resources agreed upon in
connection with the provision of such resources to the Association,
the Association shall distribute its assets to members pro rata in
proportion to amounts paid in by them on account of their
subscriptions. Any distribution pursuant to the foregoing
provision of this paragraph (c) shall be subject, in the case of
any member, to prior settlement of all outstanding claims by
the Association against such member. Such distribution shall be
made at such times, in such currencies, and in cash or other
assets as the Association shall deem fair and equitable.
Distribution to the several members need not be uniform in
respect of the type of assets distributed or of the currencies in
which they are expressed.
  * (_d_) Any member receiving assets distributed by the Association
pursuant to this Section or Section 4 shall enjoy the same rights
with respect to such assets as the Association enjoyed prior to
their distribution.
