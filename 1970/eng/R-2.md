and efficiently operated, the Minister may

repairs and improvements, may be paid to
the company owning the railway at the time
of the sale, or to the trustee for the holders of
any outstanding bonds or other securities
secured by mortgage or otherwise upon the
railway. R.S., c. 234, s. 162.

railway will pass, by reason of the passage of
the railway through or over the lands or by
reason of the construction of the railway, and

profile and book of reference with the registrar
of deeds shall be the date with reference to

may be ; and upon the hearing of the appeal
such court shall decide any question of fact
upon the evidence taken before the arbitrator
as in the case of original jurisdiction.
(3) The court may, where, from any other
evidence it deems proper to admit, it is clearly
satisfied that injustice has been done, set
aside the award or remit it to the arbitrator
for reconsideration with such directions as it
deems proper.
(4) Upon such appeal the practice and
proceedings shall be, as nearly as may be, the
same as upon an appeal from the decision of
an inferior court to the said superior court,
subject to any general rules or orders from
time to time made by the court to which such
appeal lies in respect to such appeals.
(5) The decision of such court is not, except
where the amount awarded by or claimed in
the appeal from such decision exceeds five
thousand dollars, subject to further appeal,

Paying Money into Court, etc.

**174.** (1) Where
  * (_a_) the company has reason to fear any
claim, mortgage, hypothec, or encum
brance ;
(6) any person to whom the compensation
or annual rent, or any part thereof, is
payable, refuses to execute a proper con-
veyance ;
  * (_c_) the person entitled to claim the com
pensation or annual rent cannot be found,
or is unknown to the company ; or
  * (_d_) for any other reason, the company
deems it advisable ;
the companj- may pay such compensation
into court, with the interest thereon for six
months, and may deliver to the clerk or
prothonotary of such court an authentic copy
of the conveyance, or of the award or
agreement, if there is no conveyance.
(2) Such conveyance, or award or agree
ment, shall thereafter be deemed to be the
title of the company to the land therein
mentioned. R.S., c. 234, s. 236.

**175.** (1) Where the lands are situated else
where than in the Province of Quebec, a
notice of such payment and delivery, in such
form and for such time as the court appoints,
shall be inserted in a newspaper, published in
the county in which the lands are situated,
or, if there is no newspaper published in the
county, then in the official gazette of the
province, and also in a newspaper published
in the nearest county thereto in which a
newspaper is published.
(2) The notice shall state that the convey
ance, agreement or award constituting the
title of the company is obtained under the

procured and filed as in such cases. R.S., c.
234, s. 238.

**177.** (1) The compensation for any lands
that may be taken without the consent of the
owner stands in the stead of such lands ; and
any claim to or encumbrance upon the said
lands, or any portion thereof, is, as against
the company, converted into a claim to the
compensation, or to a like proportion thereof ;
and the company is responsible accordingly,
any part thereof to a person not entitled to
receive the same, saving always its recourse
against such person.
(2) Nothing herein contained prejudices

company, such order is not obtained until
after six months have expired, the court shall
order the company to pay into court, as part
of the compensation, the interest for such
further period as is right.
(5) The costs of the proceedings, in whole
or in part, including the proper allowances to
witnesses, shall be paid by the company, .or
by any other person, as the court orders. R.S.,

satisfaction of such award or agreement and
of payment or tender of the sum awarded or
agreed upon or of payment thereof into court,

or county, or to a bailiff, as he deems most
suitable, to put down such resistance or
opposition, and to put the railway company
in possession.
(2) The sheriff or bailiff shall, in the
execution of such warrant, take with him
sufficient assistance for such purpose, and
shall put down such resistance or opposition
and put the company in possession. R.S., c.

notice, is necessary for the construction or
maintenance of some part of the railway with
which the company is ready forthwith to
proceed. R.S., c. 234, s. 243.

**182.** (1) The judge shall not grant any
warrant under section 181, unless
  * (_a_) ten days prior notice of the time and
place when and where the application for
such warrant is to be made has been served
upon the owner of the lands, or the person
empowered to convey the lands or interested
in the lands sought to be taken or which
may suffer damage from the taking of
materials sought to be taken, or the exercise
of the powers sought to be exercised, or the
doing of the thing sought to be done by the
company, and
  * (_b_) the company gives security to his
satisfaction, by payment into court, of a
sum in his estimation sufficient to cover the
probable compensation and costs of the
arbitration, and not less than fifty per cent
above the amount offered by the company
in the notice mentioned in section 156 or
certified by the surveyor or engineer under
section 157, whichever is larger; or, if the
judge deems proper, pays the party in part
and gives security for the balance.
(2) Where for any reason service of such
notice cannot be made, or cannot be made
promptly, the judge may, on proof to his
satisfaction of circumstances justifying it,
order substitutional or other service of such
notice or dispense with such notice. R.S., c.
234, s. 244.

**183.** (1) The costs of any such application
and hearing before the judge shall be borne
by the company, unless the compensation
awarded is not more than the company had
offered to pay.

interest thereon shall be repaid, or paid to
such company, or paid to such owner or party,
without an order from the judge, which he
may make in accordance with the terms of
the award. R.S., c. 234, s. 245.

same city, town or village, the Commission
may, upon the application of one of the
companies, or of a municipal corporation or
other public body, or of any person or persons
interested, order that the lines or tracks of
such railways shall be so connected, at or near
the point of intersection or crossing or in or
near such city, town or village, as to admit of
the safe and convenient transfer or passing of

authority of the Parliament of Canada, and
it is desired by the company owning or
operating either of such railways, or by any
municipal corporation, or other public body,
or any person interested, that the lines or
tracks of such railways should be connected,
so as to admit of the safe and convenient
transfer of engines, cars and trains from the
lines or tracks of one of such railways to those

railways within the legislative authority of
such province, hereinafter in this subsection
called the provincial board, proceedings may
be taken in accordance with the following
provisions :
  * (_a_) either of such companies, or any
municipal corporation, or other public body,
or any person interested, may file with the
Secretary of the Commission, and with the
secretary of the provincial board, an
application for an order that such connec
tion should be required to be made, together
with evidence of service of such application
upon the railway companies interested or
affected ; and, where the application is not
made by the municipality, upon the head
of the municipal corporation within which
the proposed connection is situated ;
(6) after the receipt of the said application,
the Commission and the provincial board
may, by joint session or conference, in
conformity with the practice established or
adopted by them, hear and determine the
said application, and may order that the
lines or tracks of such railways be so
connected at or near the point of intersec

of the Exchequer Court and shall be
enforced in like manner as any rule, order,
or decree of such court. R.S., c. 234, s. 256.

**195.** The Commission may order the
adoption and use at any such crossing or
junction at rail level, of such interlocking

any adjoining lands, shall be removed, and
(6) that nothing obstructing the view shall
be placed at such crossing or nearer thereto
than the Commission designates ;
and for any such purpose the Commission has
power to authorize or direct the expropriation
of any land, the acquirement of any easement
and the doing of anything deemed necessary,
and has power to fix and order payment of
such compensation as it deems just. R.S., c.
234, s. 261.

**200.** Notwithstanding anything in this Act
or any other Act, the Commission may order
what portion, if any, of the cost is to be borne
respectively by the company, municipal or
other corporation or person in respect of any
order made by the Commission under section
197, 198 or 199, and such order is binding on
and enforceable against any railway company,
municipal or other corporation or person
named in such order. 1955, c. 41, s. 1.

**201.** The Commission may order any
company to erect over its railway at or near,
or in lieu of any highway crossing at rail
level, a foot bridge or foot bridges, for the
purpose of enabling persons, passing on foot
along such highway, to cross the railway by
means of such bridge or bridges. R.S., c. 234,
s. 264.

**202.** (1) The sums heretofore or hereafter
appropriated and set apart to aid actual
construction work for the protection, safety
and convenience of the public in respect of
crossings shall be placed to the credit of a
special account to be known as "The Railway
Grade Crossing Fund", and shall, in so far as
not already applied, be applied by the
Commission in its discretion, subject to the
limitations set forth in this section, solely
toward the cost, not including that of
maintenance and operation, of
  * (_a_) work actually done for the protection,
safety and convenience of the public in
respect of existing crossings at rail level,
  * (_b_) work actually done in respect of recon
struction and improvement of grade sepa-
size, for the highway traffic using them,
and
  * (_c_) placing reflective markings on the sides
of railway cars.
(2) The total amount that may be applied
toward the cost of placing reflective markings
on the sides of railway cars shall not exceed
sixty per cent of such cost, and the total
amount that may be applied toward the cost
of work actually done in respect of any one
crossing shall not exceed
  * (_a_) in the case of a crossing at rail level,
the aggregate of
  * (_i_) sixty per cent of the cost of the work
(except for relocation of a public utility
plant that is part of the work) or three
hundred thousand dollars, whichever is
the lesser, and
  * (_ii_) sixty per cent of the cost of such
relocation, and
(6) in the case of reconstruction and
improvement of a grade separation, the
aggregate of
  * (_i_) thirty per cent of the cost of the work
(except the relocation of a public utility
plant that is part of the work) or one
hundred and fifty thousand dollars,
whichever is the lesser, and
  * (_ii_) thirty per cent of the cost of such
relocation.
(3) In case any province contributes toward
The Railway Grade Crossing Fund, the
Commission may apportion, direct and order
payment out of the amount so contributed by
the province for the purpose of the fund,
subject to any conditions and restrictions
made and imposed by the province in respect
of its contribution.
(4) Any amount to the credit of The
Railway Grade Crossing Fund on the 28th
day of June 1955 may, notwithstanding any
provision made prior to that day, in respect
accordance with this section toward the
of work actually done in respect of
crossings.
(5) Until otherwise provided by the Parlia
ment of Canada, there shall be credited to
The Railway Grade Crossing Fund in each
fiscal year the sum of five million dollars to
aid actual construction work for the protection,
safety and convenience of the public in respect
of crossings.
(6) No amount shall be applied by the
Commission out of The Railway Grade
Crossing Fund toward the cost of work
actually done in respect of any crossing unless
that crossing has been in existence at least
three years prior to the making of the order
by the Commission to apply the amount for
that purpose.
(7) Where a highway project involves the
construction of a grade separation crossing
and the closing of an existing crossing at rail
level or the diversion therefrom of substan
tially all highway traffic using it, the grade
separation shall, if the Commission so directs,
be deemed to be a work for the protection,
safety and convenience of the public in respect
of that existing crossing.
(8) In this section, "crossing" means any
railway crossing of a highway, or any highway
crossing of a railway, and every manner of
construction of the railway or of the highway
by the elevation or the depression of the one
above or below the other, or by the diversion
of one or the other, and any work ordered or
authorized by the Commission to be provided
as one work for the protection, safety and
convenience of the public in respect of one or
more railways of as many tracks crossing or
so crossed as the Commission in its discretion
determines. R.S., c. 234, s. 265; 1955, c. 41, s.
3 ; 1958, c. 40, s. 1 ; 1960, c. 35, s. 1 ; 1963, c. 28,
s. 3; 1966-67, c. 69, s. 78.

**203.** Unless otherwise directed or permitted
by the Commission, the highway at any
overhead railway crossing shall not at any
time be narrowed by means of any abutment
or structure to a width less than twenty feet,
nor shall the clear headway above the surface
the highway at the central part of any
structure, constructed after the 1st
day of February 1904 be less than fourteen
feet. R.S., c. 234, s. 266.

**204.** Every structure by which any railway
is carried over or under any highway or by
which any highway is carried over or under
any railway, shall be so constructed, and, at
all times, be so maintained, as to afford safe
and adequate facilities for all traffic passing
over, under or through such structure. R.S., c.
234, s. 267.

**205.** Whenever the railway crosses any
highway at rail level, whether the level of the
highway remains undisturbed or is raised or
lowered to conform to the grade of the
railway, the top of the rail may, when the
works are completed, unless otherwise directed
by the Commission, rise above or sink below
the level of the highway to the extent of one
inch without being deemed an obstruction.
R.S., c. 234, s. 268.

**206.** (1) The inclination of the ascent or
descent, as the case may be, of any approach
by which any highway is carried over or under
any railway, or across it at rail level, shall
not, unless the Commission otherwise directs,
be greater than one foot of rise or fall for
every twenty feet of the horizontal length of
such approach.
(2) Such fences or other structures as the
Commission may by order or regulation direct
shall be erected and maintained on the sides
of the approaches mentioned in subsection
(1). R.S., c. 234, s. 269.

**207.** (1) Signboards at every highway
crossed at rail level by any railway, shall be
erected and maintained at each crossing, and
shall have the words "Railway Crossing"
  * (_a_) painted on each side thereof in letters

Drainage and Power, Mining and Irrigation
Works

**208.** The company shall in constructing
the railway make and maintain suitable water
pipes, flumes, ditches and drains along each
side of, and across and under the railway, to
connect with water pipes, flumes, ditches,
drains, drainage works and watercourses upon
the lands through which the railway runs, so
as to afford sufficient outlet to drain and
carry off the water, or to convey the water
supply, and so that the then natural, artificial,
or existing drainage, or water supply, of the
lands shall not be obstructed or impeded by
the railway. R.S., c. 234, s. 271.

**209.** (1) Whenever
  * (_a_) any lands are injuriously affected by
reason of the drainage upon, along, across,
or under the railway being insufficient to
drain and carry off the water from such
lands ;
(6) any municipality or landowner desires
to obtain means of drainage, or the right to
lay water pipes or other pipes, temporarily
or permanently, through, along, upon,
across or under the railway or any works or
land of the company ; or
  * (_c_) the railway company desires to obtain
means of drainage, or the right to lay water
pipes or other pipes, temporarily or perma
nently, through, along, upon, across or
under any lands adjoining or near the
railway ;
the Commission may, upon the application
or complaint of the municipality or landowner,
or of the company, order or permit the
company to construct such drainage or lay
such pipes, and may require the applicant to
submit to the Commission a plan and profile
of the portion of the railway or lands to be
affected, or may direct an inspecting engineer,
or such other person as it deems advisable to
appoint, to inspect the locality in question,
and, if expedient, there hold an inquiry as to
the necessity or requirements for such drainage
or pipes, and to make a full report thereon to
the Commission.
such drainage may be effected, or pipes laid,
constructed and maintained, having due
regard to all proper interests, and may fix the
compensation, if any, that should be paid to
any owner injuriously affected or may direct
the compensation, if any, to be determined
under the arbitration sections of this Act.
(3) An order of the Commission is not
required in the cases in which water pipes or
other pipes are to be laid or maintained under
the railway, with the consent of the railway
company in accordance with the general
regulations, plans or specifications adopted
or approved by the Commission for such
purposes. R.S., c. 234, s. 272.

**210.** (1) Whenever by virtue of any Act of
any province through which the railway runs,
proceedings may be had or taken by any
municipality or landowner for any drainage,
or drainage works, upon and across the
property of any other landowner in such
province, the like proceedings may, at the
option of such municipality or landowner, be
had or taken by such municipality or
landowner for drainage, or drainage works,
upon and across the railway and lands of the
company, in the place of the proceedings
before the Commission provided in section

**209.**
(2) In case of any such proceedings, the
drainage laws of the province, subject to any
previous order or direction of the Commission
made or given with respect to drainage of the
same lands, apply to the lands of the company
upon or across which such drainage is required,
to the same extent as to the lands of any
landowner of such province ; but the company
has the option of constructing the portion of
any drain, or drainage work, required to be
constructed upon, along, under or across its
or lands.
(3) In the event of the company not
such option, and completing such
work within a reasonable time, and without
any unnecessary delay, such work may be
constructed or completed in the same manner
as any other portions of such work are
provided under the laws of such province to
be constructed.
(4) Notwithstanding anything in this sec
tion, no drainage works shall be constructed
or reconstructed upon, along, under or across
the railway or lands of the company until the
character of such works, or the specifications
or plans thereof, have been first submitted to
and approved of by the Commission.
(5) The proportion of the cost of the drain,
or drainage works, across or upon the railway,
to be borne by the company, shall, in all such
cases, be based upon the increase of cost of
such work caused by the construction and
operation of the railway. R.S., c. 234, s. 273.

**211.** (1) When any person having authori
ty to create, develop, enlarge or change any
water-power, or any electrical or power
development by means of water, or to develop
and operate mineral claims or mines, or to
use water for irrigation purposes, desires for
any such purpose to carry any canal, tunnel,
flume pipe, ditch or wire across, over or under
any railway, and is unable to agree with the
railway company as to the terms and
conditions upon which the same may be so
carried over, under or across the said railway,
an application may be made to the Commis
sion for leave to construct the necessary works.
(2) Upon such application the applicant
shall submit to the Commission a plan and
profile of the railway at the point where it is
desired to make such crossing, and a plan or
plans showing the proposed method of
carrying such canal, tunnel, flume pipe, ditch
or wire across, over or under the said railway,
and such other plans, drawings and specifica
tions as the Commission in any case or by
any regulation requires.
(3) The Commission may, by order, grant
application on such terms and conditions
as to protection and safety, payment of
compensation or otherwise, as it deems just
and proper, may change the plans, profiles,
drawings and specifications so submitted, and
fix the place and mode of crossing and may
give directions as to the method in which the
works are to be constructed and as to
supervision of the construction of the works
and the maintenance thereof, and order that
detailed plans, drawings and specifications of
any works, structures, equipment or appliances
required shall before construction or installa
tion be submitted to and approved by the
Commission. R.S., c. 234, s. 274.
Farm Crossings

**212.** (1) Every company shall make cross
ings for persons across whose lands the railway
is carried, convenient and proper for the
crossing of the railway for farm purposes.
(2) Livestock, in using such crossings when
at rail level, shall be in the charge of some
competent person, who shall take all reasona
ble care and precaution to avoid accidents.
R.S.,c. 234,s.275.

**213.** (1) The Commission may, upon the
application of any landowner, order the
company to provide and construct a suitable
farm crossing across the railway, wherever in
any case the Commission deems it necessary
for the proper enjoyment of his land, and
safe in the public interest.
(2) The Commission may order and direct
how, when, where, by whom, and upon what
terms and conditions, such farm crossing shall
be constructed and maintained. R.S., c. 234,
s. 276.
Fences, Gates and Cattle-guards
2 14. (1) The company shall erect and
maintain upon the railway
  * (_a_) fences of a minimum height of four feet
six inches on each side of the railway ;
(6) swing gates in such fences at farm
crossings of the minimum height aforesaid,
with proper hinges and fastenings ; and
  * (_c_) cattle-guards, on each side of the
highway, at every highway crossing at rail
level with the railway.
(2) The railway fences at every such
highway crossing shall be turned into the
respective cattle-guards on each side of the
highway.
(3) Such fences, gates and cattle-guards
shall be suitable and sufficient to prevent
cattle and other animals from getting on the
railway lands.
(4) The Commission may, upon application
made to it by the company, relieve the
company, temporarily or otherwise, from
erecting and maintaining such fences, gates
and cattle-guards where the railway passes
through any locality in which, in the opinion
of the Commission, such works and structures
are unnecessary.
(5) Where the railway is being constructed
through enclosed lands, the company shall,
by fencing its right-of-way before any existing
fences are taken down or by other effective
means, prevent cattle or other animals
escaping from or getting upon such enclosed
lands or from one enclosure to another or
upon the property of the company by reason
of such construction or of any act or thing
done by the company, its contractors, agents
or employees. R.S., c. 234, s. 277.
Gates to be Kept Closed

**215.** The persons for whose use farm
crossings are furnished shall keep the gates at
each side of the railway closed, when not in
use. R.S., c. 234, s. 278.

## OPENING RAILWAY FOR TRAFFIC
Inspection and Leave of Commission
2 16. (1) No railway, and no portion there-
of &amp;gt; sha ^ ^e opened for the carriage of traffic,
other than for the purposes of the construction
of the railway by the company, until leave
therefor has been obtained from the Commis
sion, as hereinafter provided.
(2) When the company is desirous of so
opening its railway or any portion thereof, it
make an application to the Commission
for authority therefor, supported by affidavit
of its president, secretary, engineer or one of
its directors, to the satisfaction of the
Commission, stating that the railway, or
portion thereof, desired to be opened, is in
his opinion sufficiently completed for the safe
carriage of traffic, and ready for inspection.
(3) Before granting such application, the
Commission shall direct an inspecting engi
neer to examine the railway, or portion
thereof, proposed to be opened.
(4) If the inspecting engineer reports to the
Commission, after making such examination,
that in his opinion the opening of the railway
or portion thereof so proposed to be opened
for the carriage of traffic, will be reasonably
free from danger to the public using the
same, the Commission may make an order
granting such application, in whole or in
part, and may name the time therein for the
opening of the railway or such portion there
of, and thereupon the railway, or such por
tion thereof as is authorized by the Commis
sion, may be opened for traffic in accordance
with such order.
(5) If such inspecting engineer, after the
inspection of the railway, or any portion
thereof, reports to the Board that, in his
opinion, the opening of the railway would be
attended with danger to the public using the
railway by reason of the incompleteness of
the works or permanent way, or the insuffi
ciency of the construction or equipment of
such railway, or portion thereof, he shall
state in his report the grounds for such opin
ion, and the company is entitled to notice
thereof, and shall be served with a copy of
such report and grounds, and the Commis
sion may refuse such application in whole or
in part, or may direct a further or other
inspection and report to be made.
(6) If thereafter, upon such further or other
inspection, or upon a new application under
this section, the inspecting engineer reports
that such railway, or portion thereof, may be
opened without danger to the public, the
Commission may make an order granting
such application in whole or in part, and may
name the time therein for the opening of the
railway, or such portion thereof, and there
upon the railway, or such portion thereof as
is authorized by the Commission may be
opened for traffic in accordance with such
order.
(7) The Commission, upon being satisfied
that public convenience will be served thereby,
may, after obtaining a report of an inspecting
engineer, allow the company to carry traffic
over any portion of the railway not opened
for the carriage of traffic in accordance with
subsections (1) to (6). R.S., c. 234, s. 279.
Commission May Order Railway to be Opened

**217.** The Commission, in any case where
it deems it right, may, upon the application
of any person interested or of its own motion,
order the opening of any railway or line or
any portion thereof, for traffic, and may
require the company to do all things necessary
therefor, within such time as the Commission
fixes. R.S., c. 234, s. 280.

## SAFETY AND CARE OF ROADWAY
Animals not to be at Large Near Highway
Crossings

**218.** (1) No horses, sheep, swine or other
catt l e shall be permitted to be at large upon
any highway, within half a mile of the
intersection of such highway with any railway
at rail level, unless they are in the charge of
some competent person or persons, to prevent
their loitering or stopping on such highway
at such intersection.
(2) All horses, sheep, swine or other cattle
found at large contrary to this section may,
any person who finds them at large, be
in the pound nearest to the place
they are so found, and the poundkeeper
with whom the same are impounded shall
detain them in like manner, and subject to
like regulations as to the care and disposal
thereof, as in the case of cattle impounded
for trespass on private property. R.S., c. 234,
s. 281.
Thistles and Weeds to be Kept Cut

**219.** Every company shall cause thistles
and all noxious weeds growing on the right-
of-way, and upon land of the company
adjoining the railway, to be cut down or to
be rooted out and destroyed each year, before
such thistles or weeds have sufficiently
matured to seed. R.S., c. 234, s. 282.
Dry Grass to be Removed

**220.** The company shall at all times
maintain and keep its right-of-way free from
dead or dry grass, weeds and other unnecessary
combustible matter. R.S., c. 234, s. 283.
Fire Protection
22 1. (1) The Commission may make orders
and regulations
  * (_a_) respecting the construction, use and
maintenance, in connection with the rail
way, of fire guards or other works which
may be deemed by the Commission to be
necessary and suitable to prevent, as far as
possible, fires from being started or occur
ring, upon, along or near the right-of-way
of the company ;
(6) requiring the company to establish and
maintain an efficient and competent staff
of fire-rangers, equipped with such appli
ances for fighting fires or preventing them
from spreading, as the Commission may
deem proper, and to provide such fire-
rangers with proper and suitable equipment
to enable them to move from place to place
along the line of railway with all due
speed ;
  * (_c_) requiring the company to maintain an
efficient patrol of the line of railway and
of the lands in the vicinity thereof to which
fires may spread, and generally defining
rangers in respect thereof ;
  * (_d_) requiring the company to make returns
of the names of fire-rangers in its employ
in the performance of the above-mentioned
duties, and of the places or areas in which
they are from time to time engaged ; and
  * (_e_) requiring the company to make reports
and returns of fires occurring upon or near
its right-of-way.
(2) Any such orders or regulations may be
made applicable during or after the construc
tion of the railway, or during such time, and
in such manner, as the Commission deems
proper.
(3) For the purpose of fighting and extin
guishing fires, the fire-rangers of the company
may follow the fires that spread from the
railway, to, over and upon the lands to which
they may spread.
(4) Subject to the terms and conditions of
any order or regulation of the Commission,
the company may at all times enter into and
upon any lands of Her Majesty or of any
person lying along the railway, for the purpose
of establishing and maintaining thereon the
fire guards or other protection directed by the
Commission, and for the purpose of freeing
from dead or dry grass, weeds, and other
unnecessary inflammable matter, the land
between such fire guards and the line of
railway. R.S., c. 234, s. 284.
Packing

**222.** (1) The spaces behind and in front of
every railway frog or crossing, and between
the fixed rails of every switch, where such
spaces are less than four inches in width, shall
be filled with packing up to the under side of
the head of the rail.
(2) The spaces between any wing rail and
any railway frog, and between any guard rail
and the track rail alongside of it, shall be
filled with packing at their splayed ends, so
that the whole splay shall be so filled where
the width of the space between the rails is less
than four inches.
(3) Such packing shall not reach higher
than to the under side of the head of the rail.
(4) Such packing shall consist of wood or
metal, or some equally substantial and solid
material, of not less than two inches in
thickness, and, where by this section any
space is required to be filled in on any
railway, shall extend to within one and a half
inches of the crown of the rails in use, shall
be neatly fitted so as to come against the web
of such rails, and shall be well and solidly
fastened to the ties on which such rails are
laid ; but if there is at any time any method
of packing that, in the opinion of the
Commission, is an improvement over the
present requirements, the Commission, after
hearing on notice, may authorize or direct the
use of such improved method. R.S., c. 234, s.

**285.**
Commission may Direct Inspection and Order
Repairs

**223.** (1) Whenever any complaint is made
to the Commission, or the Commission receives
information, that any railway, or any portion
thereof, is dangerous to the public using the
railway, from want of renewal or repair, or
insufficient or erroneous construction, or from
any other cause, or whenever circumstances
arise that, in its opinion, render it expedient,
the Commission may direct an inspecting
engineer to examine the railway, or any
portion thereof.
(2) The Commission may, upon the report
of the inspecting engineer, order any repairs,
renewal, reconstruction, alteration or new
work, materials or equipment to be made,
done or furnished by the company upon, in
addition to, or substitution for, any portion
of the railway, which may, from such report,
appear to the Commission necessary or proper,
and may order that until such repairs,
renewals, reconstruction, alteration, and work,
materials or equipment are made, done and
furnished to its satisfaction, no portion of the
railway in respect of which such order is
made, shall be used, or used otherwise than
subject to such restrictions, conditions and
terms as the Commission may in such order
impose.
(3) The Commission may by such order
condemn and thereby forbid further use of
any rolling stock which, from such report, it
may consider unfit to repair or use. R.S., c.
234, s. 286.
Inspecting Engineer May Forbid Operation

**224.** (1) If in the opinion of any inspecting
engineer, it is dangerous for trains to pass
over any railway, or any portion thereof,
until alterations, substitutions or repairs are
made thereon, or that any of the rolling stock
should be run or used, the engineer may, by
notice in writing
  * (_a_) forthwith forbid the running of any
train over such railway or portion of
railway ; or
(6) require that the train be run only at
such times, under such conditions, and with
such precautions, as he by such notice
specifies ; and
  * (_c_) forbid the running or using of any such
rolling stock.
(2) Such notice shall state the reasons for
such opinion of the inspecting engineer, and
distinctly point out the defects or the nature
of the danger to be apprehended.
(3) The notice may be served upon the
company owning, running, or using such
railway or rolling stock, or upon any officer
having the management or control of the
running of trains upon the railway, or the
management or control of the rolling stock.
(4) The inspecting engineer shall forthwith
report such notice to the Commission, which
may either confirm, modify or disallow the
act or order of such engineer.
(5) Notice of such confirmation, modifica
tion or disallowance, shall be duly given to
the company. R.S., c. 234, s. 287.

## ACCIDENTS
Notice to be Sent to Commission

**225.** (1) Every company shall, as soon as
and immediately after the head
of the company have received infor-

whose railway there is a telegraph or telephone
line in operation shall have a blackboard put
upon the outside of the station house, over
the platform of the station, in some conspic
uous place at each station of such company
at which there is a telegraph or telephone
office ; and when any passenger train is
overdue at any such station, according to the
time-table of such company, the station agent
or person in charge at such station, shall
write, or cause to be written, with white chalk
on such blackboard, a notice stating, to the
best of his knowledge and belief, the time
when such overdue train may be expected to
reach such station.
(2) If there is any further change in the
expected time of arrival the station agent or
person in charge of the station shall write, or
cause to be written on the blackboard in like
manner, a fresh notice stating, to the best of
his knowledge and belief, the time when such
overdue train may then be expected to reach

to a full stop, and shall not thereafter
until a proper signal has been given
for that purpose.
(2) Wherever there is adopted or in use on
any railway, at any such bridge, an interlock
ing switch and signal system or other device
that, in the opinion of the Commission,
renders it safe to permit engines and trains to
pass over such bridge without being brought
to a stop, the Commission may, by order,
permit engines and trains to pass over such
bridge without stopping, under such regula
tions as to speed and other matters, as the
Commission deems proper. R.S., c. 234, s. 308.
Precautions at Railway Crossings

**246.** (1) No train or engine or electric car
shall pass over any crossing where two main
lines of railway, or the main tracks of any
branch lines, cross each other at rail level,
whether they are owned by different compa
nies or the same company, until a proper
signal has been received by the conductor or
engineer in charge of such train or engine
from a competent person or watchman in
charge of such crossing that the way is clear.
(2) In the case of an electric car crossing
any railway track at rail level, if there is no
competent person or watchman in charge of
the crossing, it is the duty of the conductor,
before crossing and before giving the signal
to the motorman that the way is clear and to
proceed, to go forward and see that the track
to be crossed is clear. R.S., c. 234, s. 309.

**247.** Every engine, train or electric car
shall, before it passes over any crossing as
mentioned in section 246, be brought to a full
stop, except that whenever there is in use, at
any such crossing, an interlocking switch and
signal system, or other device that, in the
opinion of the Commission, renders it safe to
permit engines and trains or electric cars to
pass over such crossing without being brought
to a stop, the Commission may, by order,
permit such engines and trains and cars to
pass over such crossing without stopping,
as the Commission deems proper.
c. 234, s. 310.
Precautions at Highway Crossings and in
Thickly Populated Areas

**248.** (1) When any train is approaching a
highway crossing at rail level the engine
whistle shall be sounded at least eighty rods
before reaching such crossing, and the bell
shall be rung continuously from the time of
the sounding of the whistle until the engine
has crossed such highway.
(2) Where a by-law of an urban municipality
prohibits such sounding of the whistle or
ringing of the bell in respect of any such
crossing or crossings within the limits of the
municipality, the by-law shall, if approved
by an order of the Commission, to the extent
of the prohibition relieve the company and
its employees from the duty imposed by this
section.
(3) In subsection (2) the expression "urban
municipality" means
  * (_a_) a city;
(6) a town ; or
  * (_c_) any other municipality that contains a
thickly populated area and that the Com
mission, on the application of such munici
pality, declares to be an urban municipality
within the meaning of that subsection. R.S.,
c. 234, s. 311.

**249.** (1) No train shall pass at a speed
greater than ten miles an hour in or through
any thickly populated area of any city, town
or village, unless the track is fenced or
properly protected in the manner prescribed
by this Act, or unless permission is given by
some regulation or order of the Commission.
(2) No train shall enter any highway
crossing at rail level in any thickly populated
area of any city, town or village at a speed
greater than ten miles an hour, unless such
crossing is constructed and thereafter main
tained and protected in accordance with the
orders, regulations and directions of the
Commission, in force with respect to such
crossing, or unless permission is given by some
or order of the Commission.
(3) Where the Commission has ordered that
protection be provided at a highway crossing
at rail level for the safety and convenience of
the public, and has imposed a limitation on
the speed of trains entering the highway
crossing during the period before the protec
tion has been provided, the imposed speed
limitation shall apply in respect of such
crossing notwithstanding subsection (2), and
no train shall enter such highway crossing
during that period at a speed in excess of the
speed limitation so imposed.
(4) No train shall enter any highway
crossing at rail level at a speed greater than
twenty-five miles an hour if at such crossing
a person or vehicle using the crossing or an
animal being ridden or driven over the
crossing has been struck by a moving train,
and bodily injury or death thereby caused to
such person or any person using the crossing,
unless the Commission directs that the speed
limitation of twenty-five miles an hour shall
not be in effect at the crossing or unless the
crossing is protected to the satisfaction of the
Commission. 1963, c. 28, s. 1.

**250.** (1) Whenever in any city, town or
village, any train, not headed by an engine
or its tender, is passing over or along a
highway at rail level that is not adequately
protected by gates or otherwise, the company
shall station on that part of the train that is
then foremost a person who shall warn persons
standing on, or crossing, or about to cross the
track of such railway.
(2) The Commission, upon the application
of any railway company or person, has power
to order that this section shall not apply to
any particular trains or classes of trains, or to
trains running on any specified portions of
the railway of the company, but no such order
shall be made with respect to trains engaged
in shunting or switching, or in yard or
terminal movements. R.S., c. 234, s. 313.
Respecting the Obstruction of Highway Traffic

**251.** Whenever any railway crosses any
highway at rail level, the company shall not,
nor shall its officers, agents or employees,
wilfully permit any engine, tender or car, or
any portion thereof, to stand on any part of
such highway, for a longer period than five
minutes at one time, or in shunting, to
obstruct public traffic for a longer period than
five minutes at one time, or in the opinion of
the Commission, unnecessarily interfere there
with. R.S., c. 234, s. 314.

## ABANDONMENT AND RATIONALIZATION OF

## LINES OR OPERATIONS
Uneconomic Branch Lines

**252.** In this section and sections 253 to 258,
"actual loss", in. relation to any branch line
means the excess of
  * (_a_) the costs incurred by the company in
any financial year thereof in the operation
of the line and in the movement of traffic
originating or terminating on the line,
over
  * (_fe_) the revenues of the company for that
year from the operation of the line and
from the movement of traffic originating or
terminating on the line ;
"branch line" means a line of railway in
Canada of a railway company that is
subject to the jurisdiction of Parliament
that, relative to a main line within the
company s railway system in Canada of
which it forms a part, is a subsidiary,
secondary, local or feeder line of railway,
and includes a part of any such subsidiary,
secondary, local or feeder line of railway.
1966-67, c. 69, s. 42.

**253.** (1) The Commission may, where it
deems it necessary to do so, make rules for
the handling of applications for the abandon
ment of branch lines and may by such rules
prescribe the periods during which applica
tions shall be filed with and heard by the
Commission in respect of any particular
branch line or groups of branch lines.
(2) If a company desires to abandon the
operation of a branch line, the company shall
file an application to abandon the operation
of that line with the Commission in accordance
with any rules that may have been made by
the Commission pursuant to subsection (1);
and the Commission shall cause such public
notice of the application to be given in the
area served by the branch line as the
Commission deems reasonable.
(3) Concurrently with the filing of its
application to abandon the operation of a
branch line the company shall also submit to
the Commission a statement of the costs and
revenues of the company attributable to the
line in each of such number of consecutive
financial years of the company as the
Commission may prescribe (hereinafter in this
section and section 254 referred to as the
"prescribed accounting years") ; and the com
pany shall forthwith thereafter, in each sta
tion on the line in accordance with any regu
lation of the Commission in that behalf, post
a notice of the application to abandon the
operation of the line.
(4) If the Commission is satisfied that the
application to abandon the operation of a
branch line has been filed in accordance with
the rules and regulations of the Commission,
the Commission shall, after investigation, and
whether or not it has afforded the company
an opportunity to make further submissions,
review the statement of costs and revenues
referred to in subsection (3), together with all
other documents, facts and figures that in its
opinion are relevant, and shall prepare a
report^ setting out the amounts, if any, that
in its opinion constitute the actual loss of the
branch line in each of the prescribed account
ing years, and the Commission shall cause
such public notice of the principal conclusions
of the report to be given in the area served
by the branch line as the Commission deems
reasonable. 1966-67, c. 69, s. 42.

**254.** (1) If the Commission finds that in
in one or more of the prescribed accounting
years including the last year thereof, the
Commission shall, after such hearings, if any,
as are required in its opinion to enable all
persons who wish to do so to present their
views on the abandonment of the branch line
and having regard to all matters that to it
appear relevant, determine whether the branch
line is uneconomic and is likely to continue
to be uneconomic and whether the line should
be abandoned ; but if the Commission finds
that in its opinion the company has incurred
no actual loss in the operation of such line in
the last year of the prescribed accounting
years, it shall reject the application for the
abandonment of the operation of the line
without prejudice to any application that
may subsequently be made for abandonment
of the operation of that line.
(2) In carrying out the provisions of this
section, the Commission
  * (_a_) may consider together as a group, on
dates fixed therefor by the Commission, all
applications for abandonment of branch
lines that are situated in the same area or
adjoining areas as determined by the
Commission ;
  * (_b_) may require any company that operates
one or more branch lines in an area, as
determined by the Commission, in which
there is located at least one branch line
with respect to which an application for
abandonment of its operation has been filed
with the Commission, to furnish to the
Commission for such of its branch lines in
the area as the Commission may specify,
figures, for such a number of years and in
such form as may be specified by the
Commission, of the traffic moving over the
lines whether originating or terminating at
or moving between points on the lines, and
all such figures, with the exception of those
pertaining to branch lines for which applica
tions for abandonment of operation have
been filed with the Commission, shall be
treated by the Commission as confidential ;
and
  * (_c_) may require any company, if it has filed
applications for abandonment of the oper
ation of more than one branch line with the
Commission, to specify the order in which
it desires the Commission to consider such
applications ; but nothing in this paragraph
limits the power of the Commission to
consider such applications from any com
pany in any order that the Commission
considers expedient or desirable.
(3) j n determining whether an uneconomic
branch line or any segment thereof should be
abandoned, the Commission shall consider all
matters that in its opinion are relevant to the
public interest including, without limiting the
generality of the foregoing,
  * (_a_) the actual losses that are incurred in the
operation of the branch line ;
  * (_b_) the alternative transportation facilities
available or likely to be available to the
area served by the branch line ;
  * (_c_) the period of time reasonably required
for the purpose of adjusting any facilities,
wholly or in part dependent on the services
provided by the branch line, with the least
disruption to the economy of the area
served by the line ;
  * (_d_) the probable effect on other lines or
other carriers of the abandonment of the
operation of the branch line or the
abandonment of the operation of any
segments of the branch line at different
dates ;
  * (_e_) the economic effects of the abandonment
of the operation of the branch line on the
communities and areas served by the branch
line;
(/) the feasibility of maintaining the branch
line or any segment thereof as an operating
line by changes in the method of operation
or by interconnection with other lines of
the company ;
(0) the feasibility of maintaining the branch
line or any segment thereof as an operating
line either jointly with or as part of the
system of another railway company by the
sale or lease of the line or segments thereof
to another railway company or by the
exchange of operating or running rights
between companies or otherwise, including,
where necessary, the construction of con
necting lines with the lines of other
companies; and
  * (_h_) the existing or potential resources of the
area served by the branch line, seasonal
restrictions on other forms of transportation
therein and the probable future transporta
tion needs of the area.
(4) If the Commission determines that the
operation of an uneconomic branch line or
thereof should be abandoned, the
Commission shall by order fix such dates for
the abandonment of the operation of the line
or segments thereof as to the Commission
appear to be in the public interest; but an
abandonment date shall be
  * (_a_) not earlier than thirty days from the
date of the order ; and
(6) not later than five years from the date
of the order.
(5) If the Commission determines that the
operation of an uneconomic branch line or
segment thereof should not be abandoned,
the Commission shall so order and thereafter
shall reconsider the application for abandon
ment at intervals not exceeding five years
from the date of the original application or
last consideration thereof, as the case may be,
for the purpose of determining whether the
operation of the line should be abandoned ;
and
  * (_a_) if the Commission finds that the branch
line or a segment thereof has, since the last
consideration, become an economic line of
railway, it shall reject the application for
the abandonment of the line but without
prejudice to any application that may
subsequently be made for the abandonment
of the operation of the line ; or
(6) if the Commission finds that the branch
line or a segment thereof continues to be
an uneconomic line of railway, it shall
determine whether the operation of the line
or segment thereof should be abandoned as
provided in subsection (4) or continued as
provided by this subsection.
(6) The company shall post in each station
on the branch line to be abandoned under
this section and keep so posted for such period
as may be prescribed by the Commission a
notice of any order or direction under
subsection (4) or (5) made in respect of that
line.
(7) Where any dates have been fixed by the
Commission for the abandonment of the
operation of a branch line or segments thereof,
the company shall cease the operation of the
line and each segment thereof on the date
fixed therefor by the Commission unless
before any such date the date is extended or
the order fixing the date is rescinded by the
Commission under subsection (8).
(8) The Commission may
  * (_a_) on its own motion or upon the applica
tion of any person extend the date upon
which a branch line or any segment thereof
is to be abandoned if the Commission is
satisfied that the public interest requires
such an extension, but no extension under
this paragraph shall postpone the abandon
ment of the line or a segment thereof to a
date later than five years from the date of
the order fixing the earlier date ; or
(6) with the concurrence of the company
and on the Commission s own motion, or
upon application by the company, rescind
any order fixing the date or dates for the
abandonment of a branch line if, after such
investigation by the Commission as it may
require, the Commission is satisfied that
the branch line has become or is likely to
become an economic line of railway. 1966-
67, c. 69, s. 42.

**255.** (1) In the exercise of its duties under
section 254 the Commission may recommend
to railway companies the exchange of branch
lines between companies by lease, purchase or
otherwise, the giving or exchanging between
companies of operating rights or running
rights over branch lines or other lines of
railway, the connecting of branch lines thereof
with other lines of the company or another
company, and the abandonment of operation
of branch lines in respect of which no
applications for abandonment have been filed
with the Commission.
(2) Where, pursuant to a recommendation
made under subsection (1) by the Commission,
a branch line is connected to the lines of
another railway company, and the branch
line is thereafter operated by the company
operating the lines to which the branch line
was connected, the operating company may
under section 256 in respect of any
attributable to such branch line ; and
any expenditures incurred by the company in
connecting such line to its system shall be a
cost of operating the branch line in the year
in which the expenditure was incurred.
(3) Where a recommendation is made by
tne Commission under subsection (1), the
Commission shall report its recommendation
to the Governor in Council; and, if the
recommendation involves one or more railway
companies in cost or losses not recoverable
under section 256 or is for that or any other
reason not acceptable to one or more of such
companies, the Governor in Council may
cause to be taken such legislative or other
action as he considers necessary in the public
interest.
(4) In the exercise of its duties under section
254 the Commission may also make recom-
mendations not directly involving a railway
company
  * (_a_) in respect of the orderly handling of
traffic remaining to a branch line or any
segment thereof for which the Commission
has fixed a date for abandonment ; or
(6) in respect of any action deemed desirable
by the Commission on any matter directly
related to the abandonment of the branch
line or any segment thereof and in
particular, but without limiting the gener
ality of the foregoing, in respect of any

passenger-train service, the company shall, in
accordance with the rules and regulations of
the Commission in that regard, file with the
Commission an application to discontinue
that service.
(3) Concurrently with the filing of the
application to discontinue the passenger-train
service, the company shall also submit to the
Commission a statement of the costs and
revenues of the company attributable to the
carriage of passengers by the service in each
of such number of consecutive financial years
of the company as the Commission may
prescribe (hereinafter in this section referred
to as the "prescribed accounting years"), and
the Commission shall cause such public notice
of the application to be given in the area
served by the passenger-train service as the
Commission deems reasonable.
(4) If the Commission is satisfied that the
application to discontinue the passenger-train
service has been filed in accordance with the
rules and regulations of the Commission, the

hearings, if any, as are required in its opinion
to enable all persons who wish to do so to
present their views on the discontinuance of
the passenger-train service, and having regard
to all matters that to it appear relevant,
determine whether the passenger-train service
is uneconomic and is likely to continue to be
uneconomic and whether the passenger-train
service should be discontinued ; but if the
Commission finds that in its opinion, the
company has incurred no actual loss in the
operation of such passenger-train service in
the last year of the prescribed accounting
years, it shall reject the application without
that service.
(6) In determining whether an uneconomic
passenger-train service or parts thereof should
be discontinued, the Commission shall con
sider all matters that in its opinion are
relevant to the public interest including,
without limiting the generality of the forego
ing,
  * (_a_) the actual losses that are incurred in the
operation of the passenger-train service ;
(6) the alternative transportation services,
including any highway or highway system
serving the principal points served by the
passenger-train service, that are available
or are likely to be available in the area
served by the service ;
  * (_c_) the probable effect on other passenger-
train service or other passenger carriers of
the discontinuance of the service, or of parts
thereof; and

tation needs of the area served by the
service.

operation of an uneconomic passenger-train
service should be discontinued, the Commis
sion shall by order fix such date or dates for
the discontinuance of the operation of the
service or parts thereof as to the Commission
appears to be in the public interest ; but a
discontinuance date shall be
  * (_a_) not earlier than thirty days from the
date of the order; or
(6) not later than one year from the date
of the order.
(8) If the Commission determines that the
operation of an uneconomic passenger-train
service should not be discontinued, the
Commission shall so order, and thereafter
shall reconsider the application for discon
tinuance at intervals not exceeding five years
from the date of the original application or
last consideration thereof, as the case may be,
for the purpose of determining whether the
passenger-train service should be discon
tinued, and if
passenger-train service has, since the last
consideration, become an economic
passenger-train service, it shall reject the
application for discontinuance of the
passenger-train service without prejudice to
any application that may subsequently be
made for the discontinuance of that service ;
or
(6) the Commission finds that the
passenger-train service continues to be an
uneconomic service, it shall determine
whether the service should be discontinued
as provided by subsection (7) or continued
as provided by this subsection.
(9) The Commission shall cause such public
notice of any hearing, finding, determination,
order, reconsideration or rejection, made or
given in respect of the passenger-train service
pursuant to subsection (4), (5), (7) or (8), to be

period, or, where only a part of a
financial year is within the claim period, in
that part thereof within the claim period.
(3) A claim under this section shall be filed
with the Commission not later than three
months after the commencement of the fiscal
period next following the financial year of
the company in which the actual loss was

he deems necessary or desirable to provide
assistance in respect of such loss.

by the Governor in Council under this section
financial assistance is provided a railway
company in any years from moneys appro
priated by Parliament therefor, the payment
to such company of such assistance shall be

effective and competitive service by a common
carrier other than a rail carrier or carriers or
a combination of rail carriers, the Commission
may investigate the tariff of tolls applying to
the carriage in those quantities to or from
such point in Canada and if the Commission
finds that the tariff of tolls of a railway
or any portions of the tariff, are
as to take undue advantage of a
monopoly situation favouring rail carriers in
respect of the carriage of such goods or class
of goods, the Commission may disallow such
tariff of tolls or any portion thereof and may
require the railway company to substitute
within a specified period of time a tariff of
tolls satisfactory to the Commission or it may
prescribe other tolls in lieu of any tolls so
disallowed. 1966-67, c. 69, s. 44.

railway company is required to afford under
this section, shall include reasonable facilities

facilities for the carriage of goods by express
to any incorporated express company or
person, shall grant equal facilities, on equal
terms and conditions, to any other incorporat
ed express company that demands them.

any rate or tariff not in compliance with this
subsection and direct the company to substi
tute therefor a rate or tariff that complies
with this subsection. R.S., c. 234, s. 319; 1966-
67, c. 69, s. 45.

and published, and notice of the issue thereof
and of cancellation of any such tariff or any
portion thereof shall be given in accordance
with regulations, orders or directions made by
the Commission.

previously authorized to be charged under
this Act may be acted upon and put into
operation immediately on or after the issue
of the tariff and before it is filed with the
Commission.
(4) Where a freight tariff is filed and notice
of issue is given in accordance with this Act
and the regulations, orders and directions of
the Commission, the tolls therein shall, unless
and until they are disallowed by the Com
mission, be conclusively deemed to be the
lawful tolls and shall take effect on the date
stated in the tariff as the date on which it is
and the company shall thereafter, until such
tariff expires, or is disallowed by the Com
mission, or is superseded by a new tariff,
charge the tolls as specified therein. R.S., c.
234,s.333; 1966-67, c. 69, s. 52.

the Commission at the time of filing the tariff
or at any time, any information required by
the Commission to establish that the rates
contained in the tariff are compensatory.
(2) A freight rate shall be deemed to be
compensatory when it exceeds the variable
cost of the movement of the traffic concerned
as determined by the Commission.
(3) In determining for the purposes of this
section and section 277 the variable cost of
any movement of traffic, the Commission
shall
  * (_a_) have regard to all items and factors
prescribed by regulations of the Commission
as being relevant in the determination of
variable costs; and
(6) compute the costs of capital in all cases
by using the costs of capital approved by

**77.** (1) The Commission may disallow
an ^ frei i nt rate tnat after investigation the
Commission determines is not compensatory.
(2) Where the Commission receives infor
mation by way of a complaint or otherwise
containing prima facie evidence that a freight
rate shown in a tariff filed with the
Commission is not compensatory, the Com
mission shall conduct an investigation to
determine if such rate is compensatory, and
in any other case the Commission may, of its
own motion, conduct such an investigation.
1966-67, c. 69, s. 53(4)(5).

**278.** (1) A shipper of goods for which in
a rail carrier for an adjustment of the rate,
apply to the Commission to have the probable
range within which a fixed rate for the
carriage of the goods would fall determined
by the Commission; and the Commission
shall inform the shipper of the range within
which a fixed rate for the carriage of the
goods would probably fall.
(2) After being informed by the Commission
of the probable range within which a fixed
rate for the carriage of the goods would fall,
the shipper may apply to the Commission to
fix a rate for the carriage of the goods, and
the Commission may after such investigation
as it deems necessary fix a rate equal to the
variable cost of the carriage of the goods and
an amount equal to one hundred and fifty
per cent of the variable cost as the fixed rate
applicable to the carriage of the goods in
respect of which the application was made
(hereinafter in this section referred to as the
"goods concerned").
(3) In determining the variable cost of the
carriage of goods for the purposes of this
section, the Commission shall
  * (_a_) have regard to all items and factors
prescribed by regulations of the Commission
as being relevant in the determination of
variable costs;
(6) compute the costs of capital in all cases
by using the costs of capital approved by
the Commission as proper for the Canadian
Pacific Railway Company ;
  * (_c_) calculate the cost of carriage of the
goods concerned on the basis of carloads of
thirty thousand pounds in the standard
railway equipment for such goods ; and
  * (_d_) if the goods concerned may move
between points in Canada by alternative
routes of two or more railway companies,
compute the variable cost on the basis of
the costs of the lowest cost rail route.
(4) Where a fixed rate is made under this
the Commission shall forthwith notify
shipper of the rate so fixed, and if within
days of the mailing of the notice to the
by the Commission, the shipper enters
into a written undertaking with a railway
company, in a form satisfactory to the
Commission, to ship the goods concerned by
rail in accordance with this section, the
company shall file and publish a tariff of the
fixed rate which shall be effective upon such
date as the Commission may, by order or
regulation, direct.
(5) When a shipper enters into a written
undertaking as provided in subsection (4),
  * (_a_) the shipper shall cause to be shipped by
rail, for a period of one year from the date
the fixed rate takes effect and for so long
thereafter as the fixed rate as originally
fixed or as altered under paragraph (8)(a)
remains in force, all shipments of the goods
concerned except such shipments as the
Commission may from time to time author
ize to be shipped for experimental purposes
by another mode of transport ; and
(6) the charges for any shipments of the
goods concerned in the standard railway
equipment for goods of that type shall be
  * (_i_) except in any case coming under
subparagraph (ii) or (iii), at the fixed rate
on the basis of a minimum carload weight
of thirty thousand pounds, and for
shipments under thirty thousand pounds,
at the prevailing rate under the tariffs of
the company for goods of that type unless
the shipper assumes the charges for a
shipment of thirty thousand pounds at
the fixed rate,
  * (_ii_) except in any case coming under
subparagraph (iii), if the carload weight
of a single shipment of the goods
concerned is fifty thousand pounds or
more, at a rate to be determined by
deducting from the fixed rate an amount
equal to one-half the amount of the
reduction in the variable cost of the
shipment of the goods concerned below
the amount of the variable cost with
reference to which the fixed rate was
established, but rates need be determined
under this subparagraph only as required
and then for minimum carload weights
based on units of twenty thousand added
to thirty thousand and a rate for a carload
weight in excess of fifty thousand pounds
and between any two minimum carload
weights so established shall be the rate
for the lower of such minimum carload
weights, or
  * (_iii_) at such rate less than the fixed rate,
on the basis of such minimum carload
weight, as the shipper may negotiate with
a railway company at the time he enters
into the written undertaking or at any
time thereafter, and every such rate so
negotiated shall be filed and published
in accordance with regulations, orders or
directions made by the Commission.
(5) The Commission may require any
shipper for whom a rate has been fixed under
this section to supply any information to the
Commission, or to make available for the
inspection of the Commission, shipping books,
shipping records and invoice records of every
kind for the purpose of verifying that the
shipper has complied with paragraph (5)(a);
and where it is shown to the Commission that
the shipper has contravened that paragraph,
or where the shipper defaults in giving the
Commission any information required by it,
the Commission may authorize cancellation
of the fixed rate in respect of the goods
concerned.
(7) Where a fixed rate has been cancelled
pursuant to an authorization under subsection
(6), the company may recover from the shipper
for all goods shipped at the maximum rate
the difference between charges at the max
imum rate and charges based on the rate in
effect on such goods immediately before the
effective date of the maximum rate, and, in
addition, the company is entitled to liquidated
damages at the rate of ten per cent of the
maximum rate on all goods shipped by the
shipper otherwise than in accordance with the
provisions of the written undertaking referred
to in subsection (4).
  * (_g_) &t any time after the expiration of one
from the date th e fixed rate became
in respect of the carriage by rail of
the goods concerned,
  * (_a_) the Commission may, upon being satis
fied of a change in the variable cost in
relation to which a rate was fixed under
this section, alter the fixed rate as the
Commission may specify ;
(6) the shipper may give notice in writing
to the Commission and to any railway
company with whom he had shipped the
goods concerned that the shipper no longer
desires to be bound by the written under
taking entered into in respect of the goods
concerned on and after a date specified in
the notice, not being earlier than ten days
from the date of the notice, and thereupon
his undertaking is terminated as of the date
so specified, and the fixed rate shall be
cancelled in respect of the goods concerned ;
and
  * (_c_) where the Commission is satisfied that
there is available to the shipper in respect
of the goods concerned an alternative,
effective and competitive service by a
common carrier other than a rail carrier or
carriers or combination of rail carriers, the
Commission by order may, upon the
application of a railway company, authorize
the cancellation of the fixed rate as
originally fixed or as altered under para
graph (a) in respect of the goods concerned,
upon such date, not being earlier than ten
days from the date of the order, as is stated
in the order.
(9) An application under this section shall
be in such form and contain such information
as the Commission may by regulation or
otherwise require and without limiting the
generality of the foregoing,
  * (_a_) an application under subsection (1) shall
be accompanied by copies of all letters and
documents exchanged between the shipper
and any railway company in respect of the
negotiations between the shipper and the
rail carriers for an adjustment in the rate
applicable to the goods to be shipped or
received by the shipper ; and
(6) in the case of an application under
subsection (2) the shipper making the
application shall pay to the Receiver
General for the use of Her Majesty such
fee, if any, as may be determined by the
Commission but not exceeding in any event
twenty-five dollars.
(10) This section is subject to the Maritime
Freight Rates Act and Term 32 of the Terms
of Union of Newfoundland with Canada.
(11) This section does not apply in respect
of any freight rate in effect upon the 1st day
of August 1966, including any freight rate
payable by a shipper at a level provided for
on the principles of the Freight Rates Reduction
Act, until that freight rate advances above
the level payable by a shipper as of the 1st
day of August 1966.
(12) If the goods of a shipper pass over any
continuous rail route in Canada operated by
two or more railway companies, the expres
sion "company" as used in this section shall
be taken to mean each such company.
(13) In this section "shipper" means a
person sending or desiring to send goods
between points in Canada or who receives or
desires to receive goods shipped between
points in Canada.
(14) Notwithstanding subsection (11), where
immediately before the 23rd day of March
1967 a reduced freight rate was in effect
pursuant to section 468 of chapter 234 of the
Revised Statutes of Canada, 1952, an advance
in that rate shall be deemed not to be an
advance in the freight rate payable by a
shipper until that freight rate advances to a
level beyond any level authorized by the
Commission under section 412.
(15) Subsection (11) expires two years after
the 22nd day of March 1967 unless, before
that date, a later date is fixed for its expiration
by proclamation of the Governor in Council
in which case that subsection expires on such
later date.
(16) As soon as practicable after the expira
tion of four years from the 22nd day of March
1967 the Commission shall, after holding such
public hearings as it may deem expedient and
hearing the submissions of interested parties,
report to the Governor in Council on the
operation of this section and matters relevant
thereto and, having regard to the national
transportation policy, shall make such recom
mendations to the Governor in Council with
respect to the operation of the section as the
Commission considers desirable in the public
interest. 1966-67, c. 69, s. 53.

sucn information with respect to costs as may
be required under this Act and may agree
upon and charge common rates under and in
accordance with regulations or orders made

Passenger Tariffs

**280.** (1) The tariffs of tolls that the
company shall be authorized to issue under
this Act for the carriage of passengers between
points on the railway shall be divided into
two classes,
  * (_a_) standard passenger tariffs ; and
(6) special passenger tariffs.
(2) Standard passenger tariffs shall specify
tne maximum mileage toll or tolls to be
charged for passengers for all distances covered
by the company s railway.
(3) Special passenger tariffs shall specify
o ^ or to ^ s to ^ e charged by the company
for passengers, in every case where such tolls
are lower than the tolls specified in the
company s standard passenger tariffs.
(4) Where the Commission has reason to
i believe i ,1 that
  * (_a_) in respect of any passenger-train service
of the company that is serving areas the
principal points of which are not, in the
opinion of the Commission, connected by
an adequate highway or adequate highway
system, or
  * (_fe_) in respect of any passenger-train service
accommodating principally persons who
commute between points on the railway of
the company providing the service,
the passenger tariff or any portion thereof
applying to such passenger-train service is
unjust or unreasonable, or contrary to any of
the provisions of this Act, the Commission
may, notwithstanding any special Act or other
Act, disallow the passenger tariff or any
portion thereof that it finds unjust or
unreasonable or contrary to this Act, and
upon such suspension or disallowance, the
Commission may require the company to
substitute within a prescribed time a tariff of
tolls satisfactory to the Commission in lieu
thereof, or may prescribe other tolls in lieu of
the tolls so suspended or disallowed. R.S., c.
234,s.338; 1966-67, c. 69, s. 54.

**281.** (1) Any person, if he has reason to
believe that a tariff of tolls for the carriage
of passengers of a company, or the conditions
attached to the carriage of passengers in such
a tariff, are prejudicial to the public interest,
may apply to the Commission for leave to
appeal such a tariff or conditions, and the
Commission, if it is satisfied that a prima
facie case has been made, may grant leave to
appeal and may make such investigation of
such tariff or conditions as in its opinion may
be warranted.
(2) In conducting an investigation under
^his section, the Commission shall have regard
to all considerations that appear to it to be
relevant including
  * (_a_) the effect of the tariff or conditions on
the financial ability of the company and of
other carriers of passengers to provide
passenger services ;
(6) the effect of the tariff or conditions on
the variety and quality of passenger services
available to the public ; or
  * (_c_) whether control by, or the interest of a
railway company in, another form of
transportation service, or control of a
railway company by, or the interest in the
railway company of, any other transporta
tion service may be involved.
which the appeal was made are prejudicial to
the public interest, it may make an order
requiring the company to remove the prejudi
cial feature of the relevant tariff or conditions,
or such other order as in the circumstances
the Commission considers proper, or it may
report thereon to the Governor in Council for
any action that is considered appropriate.
1966-67, c. 69, s. 55.

**282.** (1) A standard passenger tariff shall
be filed and published, and amended or
supplemented in accordance with regulations,
orders or directions made by the Commission.
(2) Until the company files its standard
passenger tariff and such tariff is published,
no passenger or related tolls shall be charged
by the company.
(3) When the provisions of this section have
been complied with, the tolls in the standard
passenger tariff shall, except in the case of
special passenger tariffs, be the only tolls that
the company is authorized to charge for the
carriage of passengers. R.S., c. 234, s. 339;
1966-67, c. 69, s. 56.

passenger tariffs with the Commission at least
three days before the effective date and shall,
for three days previous to the date on which
any such tariff is intended to take effect,
deposit and keep on file in a convenient
place, open for the inspection of the public
during office hours, a copy of each such tariff
at every station or office of the company
where passengers are received for carriage
thereunder; but the Commission may, owing
to the exigencies of competition or otherwise,
notwithstanding anything in this section,
determine the time or manner within and
according to which publication of any such
tariff is to be made.
(2) The date of the issue and the date on
which, and the period, if any, during which,
any such tariff is intended to take effect, shall
be specified therein.
(3) When the foregoing provisions have
been complied with, any such tariff, unless
suspended or disallowed by the Commission,
shall take effect on the date stated therein as
the date on which it is intended to take effect,
and the company shall thereafter, until such
tariff is suspended or disallowed by the
Commission or expires or is superseded by a
new tariff, charge the toll or tolls as specified
therein, and such tariff shall supersede any
preceding tariff or tariffs or any portion or
portions thereof, in so far as it reduces or
advances the tolls therein.

Joint Tariffs

**284.** (1) Where traffic is to pass over any
continuous route in Canada operated by two
or more companies, the several companies
shall agree upon a joint tariff for such
continuous route and the initial company or

ney of such company, shall file such tariff
with the Commission and the other company
or companies shall promptly notify the Com
mission of its or their concurrence in such
joint tariff.
(2) The names of the companies whose lines
compose such continuous route shall be shown
by such tariffs.
(3) If the company owns, charters, uses,
maintains or works, or is a party to any
arrangement for using, maintaining or work
ing vessels for carrying traffic, by sea or
inland water, between any places or ports in
Canada, and if any such vessel carries traffic
between a port in Canada reached by such
company and a port in Canada reached by
the railway of another company, the vessel
and the railway of either company shall be
deemed to constitute a continuous route in
Canada within the meaning of this section.
R.S., c. 234, s. 341 ; 1966-67, c. 69, s. 58.

**285.** (1) In the event of failure by such
to agree upon any such joint tariff
provided in section 284, the Commission
on the application of any company or person
desiring to forward traffic over any such
route, which the Commission
considers a reasonable and practicable route,
or any portion thereof, may require such
companies, within a prescribed time, to agree
upon and file in like manner a joint tariff for
such continuous route, satisfactory to the
Commission, or may, by order, determine the
route, fix the toll or tolls and apportion the
same among the companies interested, and
may determine the date when the toll or tolls
so fixed shall come into effect.
(2) Upon any such order being made the
companies shall as soon as possible, or within
such time as the Commission may require,
file and publish a joint tariff in accordance
with this Act, and in accordance with such
order.
(3) In any case when there is a dispute
between companies interested as to the
apportionment of a through rate in any joint
tariff, the Commission may apportion such
rate between such companies. R.S., c. 234, s.
342; 1966-67, c. 69, s. 58.

**286.** (1) When traffic is to pass over any
continuous route from a point in Canada
through a foreign country into Canada, or
from any point in Canada to a foreign
country, and such route is operated by two or
more companies, whether Canadian or foreign,
the several companies shall file with the
Commission a joint tariff for such continuous
route.
(2) Nothing in this Act shall be construed
to affect any obligation imposed upon any
railway company subject to the jurisdiction
of Parliament by any other Act or any
agreement made pursuant thereto requiring
the company
  * (_a_) to maintain rates on export traffic
moving through any Canadian seaport
located in the "select territory" as defined
seaports. R.S., c. 234, s. 343; 1966-67, c. 69,
s. 59.

**287.** With respect to all traffic that is
j r r
carried from any point in a foreign country
into Canada, or from a foreign country
through Canada into a foreign country by
any continuous route owned or operated by
any two or more companies, whether Canadian
or foreign, a joint tariff for such continuous
route shall be duly filed with the Commission.
R.S., c. 234, s. 344.

**288.** (1) No company shall, by any combi
nation, contract or agreement, express or
implied, or by other means or device, prevent
the carriage of goods from being continuous
from the place of shipment to the place of
destination.
(2) No break in bulk, stoppage or interrup
tion made by such company shall prevent the
carriage of goods from being treated as one
continuous carriage from the place of shipment
to the place of destination, unless such break,
stoppage or interruption was made in good
faith for some necessary purpose, and without
any intent to avoid or unnecessarily interrupt
such continuous carriage, or to evade any of
the provisions of this Act. R.S., c. 234, s. 345.

**289.** (1) Joint tariffs are, as to the filing
and publication thereof, subject to the same
provisions in this Act as are applicable to the
filing and publication of local tariffs of a
similar description, except that joint tariffs
may be filed by one agent or company, duly
authorized by power of attorney of the initial
company ; upon any such joint tariff being so
duly filed with the Commission, the company
or companies shall, until such tariff is
superseded by another tariff or disallowed by
the Commission, charge the toll or tolls as
specified therein ; the Commission may except
from the provisions of this section the filing
and publication of any or all passenger tariffs
of foreign railway companies.
(2) The Commission may require to be
informed by the company of the proportion
of the toll or tolls, in any joint tariff filed,
that it or any other company, whether
Canadian or foreign, is to receive or has
received. R.S., c. 234, s. 346.
Presumption as to Legal Tolls

**290.** If the company files with the Com
mission any tariff and such tariff comes into
force and is not disallowed by the Commission
under this Act, or if the company participates
in any such tariff, the tolls under such tariff
while so in force shall, in any prosecution
under this Act, as against such company, its
officers, agents or employees, be conclusively
deemed to be the legal tolls chargeable by
such company. R.S., c. 234, s. 348.
Reduced Rates and Free Transportation

**291.** (1) Nothing in this Act shall be
construed to prevent

**320.** (1) In this Section
"company" means a railway company or
person authorized to construct or operate a
railway, having authority to construct or
operate a telegraph or telephone system or
line, and to charge telegraph or telephone
tolls, and includes also telegraph and
telephone companies and every company
and person within the legislative authority
of the Parliament of Canada having power
to construct or operate a telegraph or
telephone system or line and to charge
telegraph or telephone tolls ;
"Special Act" means any Act under which the
company has authority to construct or
operate a telegraph or telephone system or
line, or which is enacted with special
reference to any such system or line, and
any letters patent constituting a company s
authority to construct or operate a telegraph
or telephone system or line, granted under
any Act, and the Act under which such
letters patent were granted, and includes
the Telegraphs Act and any general Act
relating to telegraphs or telephones.
(2) Notwithstanding anything in any Act
passed before the 7th day of July 1919, all
telegraph and telephone tolls to be charged
by the company, and all charges for leasing
or using the telegraphs or telephones of the
company, are subject to the approval of the
Commission, and may be revised by the
Commission from time to time ; this subsection
does not apply to the use of telegraph or
telephone wires where no toll is charged to
the public.
(3) The company shall file with the Com
mission tariffs of any telegraph or telephone
tolls to be charged, and such tariffs shall be
in such form, size and style, and give such
information, particulars and details, as the
Commission, from time to time, by regulation,
or in any particular case, prescribes, and
unless with the approval of the Commission,
the company shall not charge and is not
entitled to charge any telegraph or telephone
toll in respect of which there is default in
such filing, or which is disallowed by the
Commission; but any company, prior to the
1st day of May 1908, charging telegraph or
telephone tolls, may, without such filing and
approval, for such period as the Commission
allows, charge such telegraph or telephone
tolls as such company was immediately prior
to the said date authorized by law to charge,
unless where the Commission has disallowed
or disallows such tolls.
(4) The Commission may permit the clas
sification of telegraph, telephone and cable
messages into such classes as it deems just
reasonable, and may permit different
rates to be charged for such different classes.
(5) The Commission may, from time to
time upon application, deal with all questions
of unreasonableness or unjust discrimination
in respect of telephone tolls resulting from
the establishment, redivision and readjust
ment of the boundaries of any base rate area
or telephone exchange area and, where it
considers such tolls to be unreasonable or
unjust or contrary to any of the provisions of
this Act, may require the company to
substitute tolls satisfactory to the Commission
in lieu thereof, or may prescribe other tolls in
lieu of the tolls published by the company.
(6) The Commission may, by regulation or
otherwise, determine and prescribe the manner
and form in which any tariff or tariffs of
telegraph or telephone tolls shall be published
or kept open for public inspection.
(7) Whenever any company or any province,
municipality or corporation, having authority
to construct and operate, or to operate, a
telephone system or line and to charge
telephone tolls, whether such authority is
derived from the Parliament of Canada or
otherwise, is desirous of using any telephone
system or line owned, controlled or operated
by the company, in order to connect such
telephone system or line with the telephone
system or line operated or to be operated by
such first mentioned company, or by such
province, municipality or corporation for the
purpose of obtaining direct communication,
whenever required, between any telephone or
telephone exchange on the one telephone
system or line and any telephone or telephone
exchange on the other telephone system or
line, and cannot agree with the company with
respect to obtaining such use, connection or
communication, such first mentioned compa
ny or province, municipality or corporation
may apply to the Commission for relief, and
the Commission may order the company to
provide for such use, connection or communi
cation, upon such terms, including compensa
tion if any, as the Commission deems just
and expedient, and may order and direct how,
when, where, by whom, and upon what terms
conditions such use, connection, or
communication shall be had, constructed,
installed, operated and maintained.
(8) No order made under subsection (7)
i , L . . , ,. , ,
a PP lies to the interchange of local conversa-
tions between persons using the telephones of
two competing systems or lines where such
systems or lines terminate upon switch-boards
located within the municipal limits of the
same city, town or village, except in the case
of rural party line telephones in non-
competitive areas, and then only when the
Commission deems such interchange to be
desirable and practicable.
(9) Upon any such application the Com-
mission shall, in addition to any other
consideration affecting the case, take into
consideration the standards, as to efficiency
and otherwise, of the apparatus and appliances
of such telephone systems or lines, and shall
only grant the leave applied for in case and
in so far as, in view of such standards, the
use, connection or communication applied for
can, in the opinion of the Commission, be
made or exercised satisfactorily and without
undue or unreasonable injury to or interfer
ence with the telephone business of the
company, and where in all the circumstances
it seems just and reasonable to grant the
same.
(10) Where the telephone system or line
operated by the company is used or connected,
for purposes of communication as aforesaid,
with the telephone system or line operated by
any other company or by any such province,
municipality or corporation, whether the
authority of such company, province, munici
pality or corporation to construct and operate
or to operate such telephone system or line is
derived from the Parliament of Canada or
otherwise, and whether such connection or
communication has been previously or is
hereafter established either by agreement of
the parties or under an order of the
Commission, the provisions of this Act with
respect to joint tariffs, in so far as they are
applicable and not inconsistent with this
section or the Special Act, apply to such
company or companies and to such province,
municipality or corporation; and the Com
mission has, for the enforcement of its orders
in this respect, in addition to all other powers
possessed by it therefor, the power to order a
discontinuance of such connection or com
munication between such different telephone
systems or lines.
(11) All contracts, agreements and arrange
ments between the company and any other
company, or any province, municipality or
corporation having authority to construct or
operate a telegraph or telephone system or
line, whether such authority is derived from
the Parliament of Canada or otherwise, for
the regulation and interchange of telegraph
or telephone messages or service passing to
and from their respective telegraph or tele
phone systems and lines, or for the division
or apportionment of telegraph or telephone
tolls, or generally in relation to the manage
ment, working or operation of their respective
telegraph or telephone systems or lines, or
any of them, or any part thereof, or of any
other systems or lines operated in connection
with them or either of them, are subject to
the approval of the Commission, and shall be
submitted to and approved by the Commission
before such contract, agreement or arrange
ment has any force or effect.
(12) Without limitation of the generality of
this subsection by anything contained in the
preceding subsections or in section 321, the
jurisdiction and powers of the Commission,
and, in so far as reasonably applicable and
not inconsistent with this section, section 321

employee or contractor of the company
taking down any part of a railway fence ;
  * (_d_) any person other than an officer, agent,

(2) Where any such animal, by reason of
being at large within half a mile of the
intersection of a highway with any railway at
rail level contrary to section 218, is killed or
injured by any train at such point of
intersection, the owner of such animal does
not have any right of action against any
company in respect of the animal being so
killed or injured ; but contravention of the

recovery of the amount of such damage in
any court of competent jurisdiction.
(2) If it is shown that the company has
usec^ m dern and efficient appliances, and
has not otherwise been guilty of any negli
gence, the total amount of compensation
recoverable from the company under this
section in respect of any one or more claims
for damage from a fire or fires started by the
same locomotive and upon the same occasion,
shall not exceed five thousand dollars.
(3) If there is any insurance existing on the

company has used modern and efficient
appliances and has not otherwise been guilty
of negligence, the total amount of damages
sustained by any claimant in respect of the

receipt of such money by the assured, as the
case may be.

company is limited to such five thousand
dollars and such sum is not sufficient to pay
all the claims in full, it shall be apportioned
among the claimants pro rata according to the
claims established.
(7) Where it is made to appear that the
total amount of the claims may exceed the
said sum, a judge of any superior court of
competent jurisdiction may make such order
as he deems fit for the proper determination
and adjustment of all such claims and of the
liability of the company, and if he deems
proper, may stay or consolidate any action or
actions, and may direct advertisement for
such claims and filing and adjudication
thereof in such manner and before such

or notice as he directs all claims not filed and
established as directed shall thereafter be
barred ; and the costs of any such proceedings
shall be paid as such judge directs.
(8) Except under or in pursuance of such
an order, the company is not entitled to have
any action under this section stayed or the
amount recoverable therein lessened because
the limitation of its liability to five
thousand dollars as aforesaid, nor does any
payment made by the company to any
claimant otherwise than under or in pursuance
of such an order prejudice the right of any
other claimant to receive his due proportion
of such five thousand dollars.
(9) Nothing in subsections (7) and (8)
prevents or prejudices any action or claim
against the company for failure to use modern
and efficient appliances or for other negli
gence.

in all property upon or along its route, for
which it may be held liable to compensate

any receiver, trustee, lessee, agent or person
acting for or employed by the company,
would constitute an offence under this Act,

Procedure

**399.** (1) If any penalty, prescribed for any
offence under this Act, or under any order,
rule or regulation of the Commission, is one

be filed in the name of the Attorney General
of Canada for the imposition and recovery of
such penalty.

the Board of Transport Commissioners for
Canada dated November 17, 1958, and that
immediately before the 23rd day of March
1967 were maintaining a rate level for
freight traffic that would have satisfied the
provisions of Order No. 101055 of that
Board dated April 27, 1960 had that Order
been in force immediately before the 23rd
day of March 1967;
"normal payment" means the payment that

would satisfy Order No. 101055 of the Board
of Transport Commissioners for Canada,
dated April 27, 1960.
(2) For each of the years 1967 to 1974,
inclusive, the Commission shall calculate the

that in its opinion are relevant, including the
methods of allocating among eligible compa
nies the sums provided before the 23rd day of
March 1967 by Parliament to reimburse such
companies for maintaining the level of rates
for freight traffic at a level that satisfied or
would have satisfied Order No. 101055 of the
Board of Transport Commissioners for
Canada dated April 27, 1960.

in respect of a railway company for a year
exceeds, or in the opinion of the Commission
is likely to exceed, the aggregate of the
amounts payable in respect of that year to a
railway company under sections 256, 258, 261
and 272, the Minister of Finance may, on the
recommendation of the Commission, pay out
of the Consolidated Revenue Fund to such
railway company, at such times and by such
instalments as the Governor in Council may
prescribe, an amount equal to the amount by
which the normal payment calculated in

account of an underpayment or overpayment
made under this section in an earlier year.

payment under this section in respect
any year, deduct from such payment
appropriate amounts for payment to any
transportation company that was subject to
Order No. 96300 of the Board of Transport
for Canada dated November
17th, 1958, and that is not a railway company,
and may recommend payment to any such
transportation company in respect of such
year of an amount based on the position of
such transportation company in relation to
railway companies under that Order. 1966-67,
c. 69, s. 74.

within the intent of paragraph 3(c) of the
National Transportation Act, that the company

or matters that appear to such Minister to be
relevant to the determination of railway
revenues and costs. 1966-67, c. 69, s. 74.
