hereinafter referred to as "commercial
grades" ; and "off grades" may be established
as hereinafter set out under such names or
names and numbers as may be designated to
describe the same respectively.
(2) The Board may, by regulation, name
and define "off grades" for all kinds or
varieties of grain that cannot be assigned to

Standards and a Committee on Eastern Grain
Standards (hereinafter referred to as the
"Western Committee" and the "Eastern
Committee"), which Committees respectively
have jurisdiction to select and settle the
standard samples to be used in the crop year
commencing on the first day of August
following in connection with the grading of
western grain and of other grain.
(2) The commissioners, the chief grain
inspector, the chairman of the grain appeal
tribunals hereafter referred to, the chief
chemist on the staff of the Board and the

Toronto Board of Trade, one of the persons
engaged in the business of exporting grain,
two of the millers of wheat flour in the

any such grade grain that has the character
istics of such grade as so defined.
(2) The standard samples of commercial
selected and settled by the Eastern

in any such commercial grade.
(3) The standard export samples selected
and settled by the Western Committee shall
govern the grading, into any grade with
respect to which a standard export sample has

or has been loaded into any railway car or
vessel, separate inspection certificates shall be
issued in respect of the quantity of each grade
of grain so loaded if the inspecting officer is
satisfied that the provision made, by bulk-
heading or otherwise, for keeping each grade
of grain separate from any other is sufficient
to prevent or to have prevented grain of
different grades becoming mixed, and in any
case in which the inspector is not so satisfied
he shall issue one inspection certificate
covering all the grain loaded into or discharged
from such car or vessel and shall endorse
thereon the number of bushels of each grade
of grain so loaded, if such number is known.
R.S., c. 25, s. 45.

**46.** When an inspecting officer has reason
to believe that any grain has been wilfully
loaded in such a manner as to lead to its

holder may have become liable by reason of
such default. R.S., c. 25, s. 137.

**138.** (1) When in any licensed public or

give notice by telegram or telephone to the
secretary of the Board and to the principal

of the grain and give such information as to
its condition as will indicate how urgently
action is required.
(2) The officer to whom such notice is given
shall, if he deems it necessary, arrange for the
inspection of the grain, and the Board, or
such officer as it may authorize generally or
specially in that behalf, shall give such
directions as the circumstances require as to
the treatment or disposition of such grain for
the benefit of the persons interested therein.
(3) No directions shall be given for the
treatment, shipment or other disposition of
the said grain without notice to the persons
interested therein unless it would clearly be
to the disadvantage of such persons to delay
the treatment, shipment or other disposition
directed until after such notice has been
given, or unless the persons interested in the
grain cannot be ascertained, and where notice
to the persons interested is directed, the Board
or officer by whom the direction is given may
determine the mode of giving notice and the
interval thereafter which should elapse before
any action is taken.

Board or any authorized officer thereof, the
grain is treated, shipped or otherwise disposed
of, the costs incurred by the manager of the
elevator in complying with the direction shall
be recoverable by the manager from the
persons respectively interested in the said
grain in proportion to their respective interests
therein, and he may also recover any other
lawful charges accruing against the grain and
payable by such persons respectively.
(6) Nothing in this section shall be construed
as relieving the manager or operator of any
elevator from the performance of any obliga
tion imposed upon him by this Act or arising
under the contract under which such grain
came into or remains in his possession, and if
the deterioration of the said grain, or its
having become or being likely to become out
of condition appears to be due to the default
of the manager of the elevator in the
performance by him of any such obligation,
the officer shall report accordingly, and the
Board may, on any such report, in the due
exercise of the powers conferred upon it by
this Act, make such order in the circumstances
as the right and justice of the case require.

appears that the handling of grain in a public
terminal elevator has resulted in the transfer
of any grain from a lower to a higher grade,
the excess in any grade shall be the property
of The Canadian Wheat Board and such
excess or the proceeds thereof shall, subject as
hereinafter provided, be disposed of by that
Board as the Governor in Council directs.
(3) From such excess there shall, before its
disposition, be deducted and returned to the
manager of the elevator a quantity of grain
equal to any deficiency that may contempo
raneously appear in any higher grade of grain
of the same class and from the proceeds of
the disposition of the balance of the excess
there shall be payable to the manager of the
day of such disposition, of any deficiency
may contemporaneously appear in any
lower grade of grain of the same class.

(2), (3) and (4), regard shall be had to any
alteration of grade made on any appeal from
an inspection officer disposed of without the
identity of the grain having been preserved
pending the appeal.
(6) The Board has power to determine the
mode of calculation to be adopted under this
section with respect to grain that, on its
receipt into any terminal elevator, has been
graded into any commercial grade or off
grade but may, nevertheless, by reason of its
subsequent treatment or otherwise, be properly
binned with grain of a statutory grade.
(7) In this section
"deficiency" means the amount by which the
sum total of the quantity of grain of any
grade discharged between two consecutive
weigh-overs and the quantity remaining in
store at the end of the same period is less

cent of the quantity of grain of that grade
received during the period ;
"excess" means the amount by which the sum
total of the quantity of grain of any grade
discharged between two consecutive weigh-
overs and the quantity remaining in store
at the end of the same period exceeds the

the quantity of that grade received during
that period after there has been added to
the last-named sum total a quantity equal

crop year the Board shall weigh over the
grain contained in every eastern elevator and
the period of time elapsing between consecu
tive weigh-overs shall not be less than nine

(2) Where upon any such weigh-over it
appears that the handling of grain in an
eastern elevator has resulted in an overage in
any grade or kind of grain, the overage shall
be the property of The Canadian Wheat
Board and such overage or the proceeds
thereof shall, subject as hereinafter provided,
be disposed of by that Board as the Governor
in Council directs.
(3) Out of the proceeds of the disposition
of such overage, there shall be payable to the
manager of the elevator the value, according
to the prices on the day of such disposition,
of any shortage that may contemporaneously
appear in other grades or kinds of grain.
(4) In this section
"overage" means the amount by which the
sum total of the quantity of grain of any
grade or kind discharged between two
consecutive weigh-overs and the quantity
remaining in store at the end of the same
period exceeds the sum total of the quantity
of that grade or kind of grain in store at
the beginning of such period and the
quantity of the same grade or kind of grain
received during that period after there has
been added to the last-named sum total a
quantity equal to one-sixteenth of one per
cent of the quantity of grain of that grade
or kind received during the period ;
"shortage" means the amount by which the
sum total of the quantity of grain of any
grade or kind discharged between two
consecutive weigh-overs and the quantity
remaining in store at the end of the same
period is less than the sum total of the
quantity of that grade or kind of grain in
store at the beginning of such period and
the quantity of the same grade or kind of
grain received during that period after there
has been added to the last-named sum total
a quantity equal to one-sixteenth of one
per cent of the quantity of grain of that
grade or kind received during the period.

order defer the weigh-over until the next
following crop year, but the deferred weigh-
over shall be made not more than twenty-two
months after the last weigh-over in that
elevator.
