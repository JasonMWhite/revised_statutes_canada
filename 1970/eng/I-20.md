## SCHEDULE
relating to Boundary Waters and Questions arising along
the Boundary between Canada and the United States,
signed at Washington, January 11, 1909.
His Majesty the King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain
and Ireland and of the British Dominions beyond the Seas,
Emperor of India, and the United States of America, being
equally desirous to prevent disputes regarding the use of
boundary waters and to settle all questions which are now
pending between the United States and the Dominion of Canada
involving the rights, obligations, or interests of either in relation
to the other or to the inhabitants of the other, along their
common frontier, and to make provision for the adjustment and
settlement of all such questions as may hereafter arise, have
resolved to conclude a treaty in furtherance of these ends, and
for that purpose have appointed as their respective plenipoten
tiaries :
His Britannic Majesty, the Right Honourable James Bryce,
O.M., his Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary at
Washington; and
The President of the United States of America, Elihu Root,
Secretary of State of the United States;
Who, after having communicated to one another their full
powers, found in good and due form, have agreed upon the
following articles :
Preliminary Article
For the purposes of this treaty boundary waters are defined
as the waters from main shore to main shore of the lakes and
rivers and connecting waterways, or the portions thereof, along
which the international boundary between the United States
and the Dominion of Canada passes, including all bays, arms,
and inlets thereof, but not including tributary waters which in
their natural channels would flow into such lakes, rivers, and
waterways, or waters flowing from such lakes, rivers, and
waterways, or the waters of rivers flowing across the boundary.
Article I
The High Contracting Parties agree that the navigation of all
navigable boundary waters shall forever continue free and open
for the purposes of commerce to the inhabitants and to the
ships, vessels, and boats of both countries equally, subject,
however, to any laws and regulations of either country, within
its own territory, not inconsistent with such privilege of free
navigation and applying equally and without discrimination to
the inhabitants, ships, vessels, and boats of both countries.
It is further agreed that so long as this treaty shall remain in
force, this same right of navigation shall extend to the waters
of Lake Michigan and to all canals connecting boundary waters,
and now existing or which may hereafter be constructed on
either side of the line. Either of the High Contracting Parties
may adopt rules and regulations governing the use of such
canals within its own territory and may charge tolls for the use
thereof, but all such rules and regulations and all tolls charged
shall apply alike to the subjects or citizens of the High
Contracting Parties and the ships, vessels, and boats of both of
the High Contracting Parties, and they shall be placed on terms
of equality in the use thereof.
Article II
Each of the High Contracting Parties reserves to itself or to
several State Governments on the one side and the Dominion
Provincial Governments on the other as the case may be,
to any treaty provisions now existing with respect
thereto, the exclusive jurisdiction and control over the use and
diversion, whether temporary or permanent, of all waters on its
own side of the line which in their natural channels would flow
across the boundary or into boundary waters; but it is agreed
that any interference with or diversion from their natural
channel of such waters on either side of the boundary, resulting
in any injury on the other side of the boundary, shall give rise
to the same rights and entitle the injured parties to the same
legal remedies as if such injury took place in the country where
such diversion or interference occurs; but this provision shall
not apply to cases already existing or to cases expressly covered
by special agreement between the parties hereto.
It is understood, however, that neither of the High Contracting
Parties intends by the foregoing provision to surrender any
right, which it may have, to object to any interference with or
diversions of waters on the other side of the boundary- the effect
of which would be productive of material injury to the navigation
interests on its own side of the boundary.
Article III
It is agreed that, in addition to the uses, obstructions, and
diversions heretofore permitted or hereafter provided for by
special agreement between the Parties hereto, no further or
other uses or obstructions or diversions, whether temporary or
permanent, of boundary waters on either side of the line,
affecting the natural level or flow of boundary waters on the
other side of the line, shall be made except by authority of the
United States or the Dominion of Canada within their respective
jurisdictions and with the approval, as hereinafter provided, of
a joint commission, to be known as the International Joint
Commission.
The foregoing provisions are not intended to limit or interfere
with the existing rights of the Government of the United States
on the one side and the Government of the Dominion of Canada
on the other, to undertake and carry on governmental works in
boundary waters for the deepening of channels, the construction
of breakwaters, the improvement of harbors, and other
governmental works for the benefit of commerce and navigation,
provided that such works are wholly on its own side of the line
and do not materially affect the level or flow of the boundary
waters on the other, nor are such provisions intended to interfere
with the ordinary use of such waters for domestic and sanitary
purposes.
Article IV
The High Contracting Parties agree that, except in cases
provided for by special agreement between them, they will not
permit the construction or maintenance on their respective sides
of the boundary of any remedial or protective works or any
dams or other obstructions in waters flowing from boundary
waters or in waters at a lower level than the boundary in rivers
flowing across the boundary, the effect of which is to raise the
natural level of waters on the other side of the boundary unless
the construction or maintenance thereof is approved by the
International Joint Commission.
It is further agreed that the waters herein defined as boundary
and waters flowing across the boundary shall not be
on either side to the injury of health or property on
the other.
Article V
The High Contracting Parties agree that it is expedient to
limit the diversion of waters from the Niagara River so that the
level of Lake Erie and the flow of the stream shall not be
appreciably affected. It is the desire of both Parties to accomplish
this object with the least possible injury to investments which
have already been made in the construction of power plants on
the United States side of the river under grants of authority
from the State of New York, and on the Canadian side of the
river under licenses authorized by the Dominion of Canada and
the Province of Ontario.
So long as this treaty shall remain in force, no diversion of
the waters of the Niagara River above the Falls from the natural
course and stream thereof shall be permitted except for the
purposes and to the extent hereinafter provided.
The United States may authorize and permit the diversion
within the State of New York of the waters of the said river
above the Falls of Niagara, for power purposes, not exceeding
in the aggregate a daily diversion at the rate of twenty thousand
cubic feet of water per second.
The United Kingdom, by the Dominion of Canada, or the
Province of Ontario, may authorize and permit the diversion
within the Province of Ontario of the waters of said river above
the Falls of Niagara, for power purposes, not exceeding in the
aggregate a daily diversion at the rate of thirty-six thousand
cubic feet of water per second.
The prohibitions of this article shall not apply to the diversion
of water for sanitary or domestic purposes, or for the service of
canals for the purposes of navigation.
Article VI
The High Contracting Parties agree that the St. Mary and
Milk Rivers and their tributaries (in the State of Montana and
the Provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan) are to be treated as
one stream for the purposes of irrigation and power, and the
waters thereof shall be apportioned equally between the two
countries, but in making such equal apportionment more than
half may be taken from one river and less than half from the
other by either country so as to afford a more beneficial use to
each. It is further agreed that in the division of such waters
during the irrigation season, between the 1st of April and 31st
of October, inclusive, annually, the United States is entitled to
a prior appropriation of 500 cubic feet per second of the waters
of the Milk River, or so much of such amount as constitutes
three-fourths of its natural flow, and that Canada is entitled to
a prior appropriation of 500 cubic feet per second of the flow of
St. Mary River, or so much of such amount as constitutes three-
fourths of its natural flow.
The channel of the Milk River in Canada may be used at the
convenience of the United States for the conveyance, while
passing through Canadian territory, of waters diverted from the
St. Mary River. The provisions of Article II of this treaty shall
apply to any injury resulting to property in Canada from the
conveyance of such waters through the Milk River.
The measurement and apportionment of the water to be used
each country shall from time to time be made jointly by the
constituted reclamation officers of the United States
the properly constituted irrigation officers of His Majesty
the direction of the International Joint Commission.
Article VII
The High Contracting Parties agree to establish and maintain
an International Joint Commission of the United States and
Canada composed of six commissioners, three on the part of the
United States appointed by the President thereof, and three on
the part of the United Kingdom appointed by His Majesty on
the recommendation of the Governor in Council of the Dominion
of Canada.
Article VIII
This International Joint Commission shall have jurisdiction
over and shall pass upon all cases involving the use or obstruction
or diversion of the waters with respect to which under Articles
III and IV of this treaty the approval of this Commission is
required, and in passing upon such cases the Commission shall
be governed by the following rules or principles which are
adopted by the High Contracting Parties for this purpose :
The High Contracting Parties shall have, each on its own
side of the boundary, equal and similar rights in the use of the
waters hereinbefore defined as boundary waters.
The following order of precedence shall be observed among
the various uses enumerated hereinafter for these waters, and
no use shall be permitted which tends materially to conflict with
or restrain any other use which is given preference over it in
this order of precedence :
(1) Uses for domestic and sanitary purposes;
(2) Uses for navigation, including the service of canals for the
purposes of navigation ;
(3) Uses for power and for irrigation purposes.
The foregoing provisions shall not apply to or disturb any
existing uses of boundary waters on either side of the boundary.
The requirement for an equal division may in the discretion
of the Commission be suspended in cases of temporary diversions
along boundary waters at points where such equal division can
not be made advantageously on account of local conditions, and
where such diversion does not diminish elsewhere the amount
available for use on the other side.
The Commission in its discretion may make its approval in
any case conditional upon the construction of remedial or
protective works to compensate so far as possible for the
particular use or diversion proposed, and in such cases may
require that suitable and adequate provision, approved by the
Commission, be made for the protection and indemnity against
injury of any interests on either side of the boundary.
In cases involving the elevation of the natural level of waters
on either side of the line as a result of the construction or
maintenance on the other side of remedial or protective works
or dams or other obstructions in boundary waters or in waters
flowing therefrom or in waters below the boundary in rivers
flowing across the boundary, the Commission shall require, as a
condition of its approval thereof, that suitable and adequate
provision, approved by it, be made for the protection and
indemnity of all interests on the other side of the line which
may be injured thereby.
of difference, and if an agreement is reached between them, it
shall be reduced to writing in the form of a protocol and shall
be communicated to the Commissioners, who shall take such
further proceedings as may be necessary to carry out such
agreement.
Article IX
The High Contracting Parties further agree that any other
questions or matters of difference arising between them involving
the rights, obligations, or interests of either in relation to the
other or to the inhabitants of the other, along the common
frontier between the United States and the Dominion of Canada,
shall be referred from time to time to the International Joint
Commission for examination and report, whenever either the
Government of the United States or the Government of the
Dominion of Canada shall request that such questions or matters
of difference be so referred.
The International Joint Commission is authorized in each
case so referred to examine into and report upon the facts and
circumstances of the particular questions and matters referred,
together with such conclusions and recommendations as may be
appropriate, subject, however, to any restrictions or exceptions
which may be imposed with respect thereto by the terms of the
reference.
Such reports of the Commission shall not be regarded as
decisions of the questions or matters so submitted either on the
facts or the law, and shall in no way have the character of an
arbitral award.
The Commission shall make a joint report to both Govern
ments in all cases in which all or a majority of the Commissioners
agree, and in case of disagreement the minority may make a
joint report to both Governments, or separate reports to their
respective Governments.
In case the Commission is evenly divided upon any question
or matter referred to it for report, separate reports shall be made
by the Commissioners on each side to their own Government.
Article X
Any questions or matters of difference arising between the
High Contracting Parties involving the rights, obligations, or
interests of the United States or of the Dominion of Canada
either in relation to each other or to their respective inhabitants,
may be referred for decision to the International Joint
Commission by the consent of the two Parties, it being
understood that on the part of the United States any such
action will be by and with the advice and consent of the Senate,
and on the part of His Majesty s Government with the consent
of the Governor General in Council. In each case so referred,
the said Commission is authorized to examine into and report
upon the facts and circumstances of the particular questions and
matters referred, together with such conclusions and recommen
dations as may be appropriate, subject, however, to any
restrictions or exceptions which may be imposed with respect
thereto by the terms of the reference.
A majority of the said Commission shall have power to render
a decision or finding upon any of the questions or matters so
referred.
If the said Commission is equally divided or otherwise unable
to render a decision or finding as to any questions or matters so
referred, it shall be the duty of the Commissioners to make a
joint report to both Governments, or separate reports to their
respective Governments, showing the different conclusions
arrived at with regard to the matters or questions so referred,
which questions or matters shall thereupon be referred for
decision by the High Contracting Parties to an umpire chosen
in accordance with the procedure prescribed in the fourth, fifth,
and sixth paragraphs of Article XLV of The Hague Convention
for the pacific settlement of international disputes, dated
October 18, 1907. Such umpire shall have power to render a final
decision with respect to those matters and questions so referred
on which the Commission failed to agree.
Article XI

made bv the Commission shall be transmitted to and filed with
the Secretary of State of the United States and the Governor
General of the Dominion of Canada, and to them shall be
addressed all communications of the Commission.
Article XII
The International Joint Commission shall meet and organize
at Washington promptly after the members thereof are
appointed, and when organized the Commission may fix such
times and places for its meetings as may be necessary, subject
at all times to special call or direction by the two Governments.

Commission after his appointment, shall, before proceeding with
the work of the Commission, make and subscribe a solemn
declaration in writing that he will faithfully and impartially
perform the duties imposed upon him under this treaty, and
such declaration shall be entered on the records of the
proceedings of the Commission.
The United States and Canadian sections of the Commission
may each appoint a secretary, and these shall act as joint
secretaries of the Commission at its joint sessions, and the
Commission may employ engineers and clerical assistants from
time to time as it may deem advisable. The salaries and personal
expenses of the Commission and of the secretaries shall be paid
by their respective Governments, and all reasonable and
necessary joint expenses of the Commission, incurred by it, shall
be paid in equal moieties by the High Contracting Parties.
The Commission shall have power to administer oaths to
witnesses, and to take evidence on oath whenever deemed
necessary in any proceeding, or inquiry, or matter within its
jurisdiction under this treaty, and all parties interested therein
shall be given convenient opportunity to be heard, and the High
Contracting Parties agree to adopt such legislation as may be
appropriate and necessary to give the Commission the powers
above mentioned on each side of the boundary, and to provide
for the issue of subpoenas and for compelling the attendance of
witnesses in proceedings before the Commission. The Commission
may adopt such rules of procedure as shall be in accordance
with justice and equity, and may make such examination in
person and through agents or employees as may be deemed
advisable.
Article XIII
In all cases where special agreements between the High
Parties hereto are referred to in the foregoing
articles, such agreements are understood and intended to include

Parties, but also any mutual arrangement between the United
States and the Dominion of Canada expressed by concurrent or
reciprocal legislation on the part of Congress and the Parliament
of the Dominion.
