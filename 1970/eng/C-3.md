twenty thousand dollars.
(2) Where a person has deposits with two or
mor 6 member institutions that amalgamate
and continue in operation as one member
institution (in this section called the
"amalgamated institution"), a deposit of that
person with an amalgamating institution on
the day the amalgamated institution is
formed, less any withdrawals from such
deposit, shall, for the purpose of deposit
insurance with the Corporation, be deemed to
be and continue to be separate from any
deposit of such person on that day with the
other amalgamating institution or institutions
that become part of the amalgamated insti
tution, but a deposit made by such person
with the amalgamated institution after the
day that the amalgamated institution is
formed shall be insured by the Corporation
only to the extent that the aggregate of that
person s deposits with the amalgamated
institution, exclusive of the deposit in respect
of which the calculation is made, is less than

which the deposit was made,
  * (_a_) by making available to such person a
transferred deposit with another member

insured by the Corporation ; or
(6) by paying such person an amount in
money equal to so much of his deposit as is
insured by the Corporation.

deposit, and in no case is the Corporation
under any obligation to see to the proper
application in any way of the payment so
made.
(6) Where the Corporation makes a pay
ment under this section in respect of any

insurance provided pursuant to this section.

insured under this section, the Corporation
shall

cate of deposit insurance in the form
prescribed by the by-laws, and

institution a premium in accordance with
section 19. 1966-67, c. 70, s. 14.

the Corporation as an overdue charge is
recoverable by action in any court of
competent jurisdiction. 1966-67, c. 70, s. 15.
