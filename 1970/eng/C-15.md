in the bill of lading, then, notwithstanding
anything in the Rules, the bill of lading shall
not be deemed to be prima facie evidence
against the carrier of the receipt of goods of
the weight so inserted in the bill of lading,
and the accuracy thereof at the time of
shipment shall not be deemed to have been
guaranteed by the shipper. R.S., c. 291, s. 6.

  * (_a_) "carrier" includes the owner or the charterer who enters
into a contract of carriage with a shipper ;
(6) "contract of carriage" applies only to contracts of carriage
covered by a bill of lading or any similar document of title,
in so far as such document relates to the carriage of goods by

as aforesaid issued under or pursuant to a charterparty from
the moment at which such bill of lading or similar document
of title regulates the relations between a carrier and a holder
of the same ;
  * (_c_) "goods" includes goods, wares, merchandise, and articles
of every kind whatsoever, except live animals and cargo
which by the contract of carriage is stated as being carried on
deck and is so carried ;
  * (_d_) "ship" means any vessel used for the carriage of goods
by water ;
  * (_e_) "carriage of goods" covers the period from the time when
the goods are loaded on to the time when they are discharged
from the ship.
Article II
Risks
Subject to the provisions of Article VI, under every contract
of carriage of goods by water the carrier, in relation to the
loading, handling, stowage, carriage, custody, care, and dis
charge of such goods, shall be subject to the responsibilities and
liabilities and entitled to the rights and immunities hereinafter
set forth.
Article III
Responsibilities and Liabilities

**1.** The carrier shall be bound, before and at the beginning of
the voyage, to exercise due diligence to,
  * (_a_) make the ship seaworthy ;
  * (_b_) properly man, equip, and supply the ship;
  * (_c_) make the holds, refrigerating and cool chambers, and all
other parts of the ship in which goods are carried, fit and safe
for their reception, carriage and preservation.

**2.** Subject to the provisions of Article IV, the carrier shall
properly and carefully load, handle, stow, carry, keep, care for
and discharge the goods carried.

**3.** After receiving the goods into his charge, the carrier, or
the master or agent of the carrier, shall, on demand of the
shipper, issue to the shipper a bill of lading showing among
other things,
  * (_a_) the leading marks necessary for identification of the
goods as the same are furnished in writing by the shipper
before the loading of such goods starts, provided such mai-ks
shipper ;
  * (_c_) the apparent order and condition of the goods:
Provided that no carrier, master or agent of the carrier, shall
be bound to state or show in the bill of lading any marks,
number, quantity, or weight which he has reasonable ground for
suspecting not accurately to represent the goods actually re
ceived or which he has had no reasonable means of checking.

**4.** Such a bill of lading shall be prima facie evidence of the
receipt by the carrier of the goods as therein described in
accordance with paragraph 3(a),(b), and (c).

**5.** The shipper shall be deemed to have guaranteed to the
carrier the accuracy at the time of shipment of the marks,
number, quantity, and weight, as furnished by him, and the
shipper shall indemnify the carrier against all loss, damages,
and expenses arising or resulting from inaccuracies in such
particulars. The right of the carrier to such indemnity, shall in
no way limit his responsibility and liability under the contract
of carriage to any person other than the shipper.

**6.** Unless notice of loss or damage and the general nature of
such loss or damage be given in writing to the carrier or his
agent at the port of discharge before or at the time of the
removal of the goods into the custody of the person entitled to
delivery thereof under the contract of carriage, or, if the loss
or damage be not apparent, within three days, such removal
shall be prima facie evidence of the delivery by the carrier of
the goods as described in the bill of lading.
The notice in writing need not be given if the state of the
goods has at the time of their receipt been the subject of joint
survey or inspection.
In any event the carrier and the ship shall be discharged
from all liability in respect of loss or damage unless suit is
brought within one year after delivery of the goods or the date
when the goods should have been delivered.
In the case of any actual or apprehended loss or damage the
carrier and the receiver shall give all reasonable facilities to
each other for inspecting and tallying the goods.

**7.** After the goods are loaded the bill of lading to be issued
by the carrier, master or agent of the carrier, to the shipper
shall, if the shipper so demands, be a "shipped" bill of lading,
provided that if the shipper shall have previously taken up any
document of title to such goods, he shall surrender the same as
against the issue of the "shipped" bill of lading, but at the
option of the carrier such document of title may be noted at
the port of shipment by the carrier, master, or agent with the
name or names of the ship or ships upon which the goods have
been shipped and the date or dates of shipment, and when so
the same shall for the purpose of this Article be deemed
to constitute a "shipped" bill of lading.

**8.** Any clause, covenant or agreement in a contract of car
relieving the carrier or the ship from liability for loss or
to or in connection with goods arising from negligence,
or failure in the duties and obligations provided in this
Article or lessening such liability otherwise than as provided in
these Rules, shall be null and void and of no effect.
A benefit of insurance or similar clause shall be deemed to
be a clause relieving the carrier from liability.
Article IV
Rights and Immunities

**1.** Neither the carrier nor the ship shall be liable for loss or
damage arising or resulting from unseaworthiness unless caused
by want of due diligence on the part of the carrier to make the
ship seaworthy, and to secure that the ship is properly manned,
equipped and supplied, and to make the holds, refrigerating and
cool chambers and all other parts of the ship in which goods are
carried fit and safe for their reception, carriage and preserva
tion in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 of
Article III.
Whenever loss or damage has resulted from unseaworthiness,
the burden of proving the exercise of due diligence shall be on
the carrier or other person claiming exemption under this
section.

**2.** Neither the carrier nor the ship shall be responsible for loss
or damage arising or resulting from,

  * (_o_) insufficiency or inadequacy of marks;
  * (_p_) latent defects not discoverable by due diligence;
(&amp;lt;?) any other cause arising without the actual fault and
privity of the carrier, or without the fault or neglect of the

shall be on the person claiming the benefit of this exception
to show that neither the actual fault or privity of the carrier
nor the fault or neglect of the agents or servants of the
carrier contributed to the loss or damage.

**3.** The shipper shall not be responsible for loss or damage
sustained by the carrier or the ship arising or resulting from any
cause without the act, fault or neglect of the shipper, his agents
or his servants.

**4.** Any deviation in saving or attempting to save life or
property at sea, or any reasonable deviation shall not be
deemed to be an infringement or breach of these Rules or of
the contract of carriage, and the carrier shall not be liable for
any loss or damage resulting therefrom.

**5.** Neither the carrier nor the ship shall in any event be or
become liable for any loss or damage to or in connection with
goods in an amount exceeding five hundred dollars per package
or unit, or the equivalent of that sum in other currency, unless
the nature and value of such goods have been declared by the
shipper before shipment and inserted in the bill of lading.
This declaration if embodied in the bill of lading shall be
prima facie evidence, but shall not be binding or conclusive on
the carrier.
By agreement between the carrier, master or agent of the
carrier and the shipper another maximum amount than that
mentioned in this paragraph may be fixed, provided that such
maximum shall not be less than the figure above named.
Neither the carrier nor the ship shall be responsible in any
event for loss or damage to or in connection with goods if the
nature or value thereof has been knowingly misstated by the
shipper in the bill of lading.

**6.** Goods of an inflammable, explosive or dangerous nature
to the shipment whereof the carrier, master or agent of the
carrier, has not consented, with knowledge of their nature and
character, may at any time before discharge be landed at any
place or destroyed or rendered innocuous by the carrier without
compensation, and the shipper of such goods shall be liable for
all damages and expenses directly or indirectly arising out of or
resulting from such shipment.
If any such goods shipped with such knowledge and consent
shall become a danger to the ship or cargo, they may in like
manner be landed at any place or destroyed or rendered
innocuous by the carrier without liability on the part of the
carrier except to general average, if any.

mercial shipments made in the ordinary course of trade, but
only to other shipments where the character or condition of the

from entering into any agreement, stipulation, condition, reser
vation or exemption as to the responsibility and liability of the
