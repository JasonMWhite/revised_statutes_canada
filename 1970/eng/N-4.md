Canada in which he is domiciled, and upon
transfer to that province he shall be kept in
custody until the pleasure of the lieutenant
governor of the province is known and the
lieutenant governor may make an order for
the safe custody of such person, as if the same
decision had been made in respect of him by
civil court in that province ; and, in the case
an accused person who is not domiciled in
any province, the Minister may make such
arrangements for the benefit and welfare of
that person as to the Minister seem fit.
(5) No decision of a court martial that an
accused person is unfit to stand or continue
his trial by reason of insanity prevents that
person being afterwards tried in respect of the
offence or of any other offence of which he
might have been found guilty on the same
charge; and the period during which he is
unfit to stand or continue his trial by reason
of insanity shall not be taken into account in
applying to him in respect of that offence the
provisions of section 59. U.S., c. 184, s. 166.
Decision Where Accused Insane When Offence
Committed

martial that a person charged with a service
offence was insane at the time of the
commission of that offence, the court martial,

offence, shall make a special finding as to
whether he was insane at the time of the
commission of the offence and whether he
was found not guilty by reason of insanity.
(2) Where a court martial held in Canada
makes a special finding under subsection (1)
that an accused person was insane, it shall
order that person to be kept in strict custody
and he shall be kept in custody until the
pleasure of the lieutenant governor of the
province is known and the lieutenant governor
may make an order for the safe custody of
such person, as if the same finding had been
made in respect of him by a civil court in the
province of Canada in which that court
martial was held.

Canada makes a special finding under
subsection (1) that an accused person was
insane, it shall order that person to be kept
in strict custody and he shall be transferred,
as soon as conveniently may be, to the
of Canada in which he is domiciled,
upon transfer to that province he shall
kept in custody until the pleasure of the
lieutenant governor of the province is known
and the lieutenant governor may make an
order for the safe custody of such person, as
if the same finding had been made in respect
of him by a civil court in that province ; and,
in the case of an accused person who is not
domiciled in any province, the Minister may
make such arrangements for the benefit and
welfare of that person as to the Minister seem
fit. R.S., c. 184, s. 167.

Conditions Applicable to New Punishments

punishment that could not legally have
been imposed by the service tribunal on the
charges of which the offender was found
guilty and in respect of which the findings
have not been quashed or set aside by way
of substitution ;
(6) the new punishment shall not be higher
in the scale of punishments than the
punishment imposed by the service tribunal
in the first instance and, if the sentence
passed by the service tribunal included a
punishment of incarceration, the new pun
ishment shall not involve a period of
incarceration exceeding the period com
prised in that sentence ;
  * (_c_) where the new punishment is detention
and the punishment that it replaces is
imprisonment for two years or more or
imprisonment for less than two years, the
term of detention from the date of alteration

Act, a new punishment, by reason of substi
tution or commutation, replaces a punishment
imposed by a service tribunal, the new
punishment has force and effect as if it had
been imposed by the service tribunal in the
first instance and the provisions of the Code
of Service Discipline apply accordingly ; but

ation, the term of the new punishment shall
be reckoned from the date of substitution or
commutation, as the case may be. R.S., c. 184,
s. 176.

of not more than three months, be reviewed
by a suspending authority and if on such
review it appears to the suspending authority
that the conduct of the offender, since the
punishment was suspended, has been such as
to justify a remission of the punishment, he
shall remit it.
(7) A punishment, except a punishment
referred to in subsection (10), that has been
suspended shall be deemed to be wholly
remitted on the expiration of a period,
commencing on the day the suspension was

suspended under this section is put into
