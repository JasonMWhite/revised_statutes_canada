benefit accruing to that elector during the
subsistence of the election, as a consequence
of his having so elected, as the Governor in
Council by regulation prescribes.
(5) Notwithstanding this Act or the Super
annuation Act, where the Governor in Council
is of opinion that a person
  * (_a_) has made an election under either this
Part or that Act in purported compliance
with this Part or that Act and the regulations
made pursuant thereto and that the pur
ported election was made in good faith and
was invalid by reason only of circumstances
not attributable to fault on the part of that
person, or

have elected pursuant to paragraph 40(2)(6),

valid election for the purposes of the relevant
provisions of this Part or the Superannuation
Act, as the case may be, on such date and
subject to such terms and conditions as may
be prescribed by the Governor in Council.
(6) Subject to this section, any amount
required by subsection 6(1) to be paid by a
contributor in respect of any period of service
for which he has elected to pay shall be paid
by him into the Superannuation Account

the election, or

computed on such bases as to mortality and
interest as the Governor in Council by
regulation prescribes,
at his option.

under this Part or the Superannuation Act to
pay for any period of service and has
undertaken to pay for that period of service
in instalments ceases to be employed in the
Public Service before all the instalments have
been paid, the unpaid instalments may be
reserved, in accordance with the regulations,
from any amount payable to him by Her
Majesty in right of Canada, including any
annuity or other benefit payable to him under
this Part, until such time as
  * (_a_) all the instalments have been paid, or
  * (_b_) the contributor dies,
whichever occurs first.
(8) Where any amount payable by a
contributor into the Superannuation Account
by reservation from salary or otherwise has
become due, but remains unpaid at the time
of his death, that amount, with interest at
four per cent per annum from the time when
it became due, may be recovered, in accordance
with the regulations, from any allowance
payable under this Part to the widow and
children of the contributor, without prejudice
to any other recourse available to Her Majesty
with respect to the recovery thereof, and any
amount so recovered shall be credited to the
Superannuation Account and shall be deemed,
for the purposes of the definition "a return of
contributions" in subsection 9(1), to have been
