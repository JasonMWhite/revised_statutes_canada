regulations concerning matters relating to any
to which this Act applies, and not
provided for by this or any other
Act, and for fixing the rates of toll and the
dues to be charged for the use of any such
works, or of any series of such works, the rates
in such latter case to be denominated through

any assertion of fact or any statement in
relation to any matter to which this Act or

verified by the oath of the person making
such assertion of fact or statement ; and the
oath so authorized may be administered by
any judge or clerk of any county or circuit
court, or any justice of the peace, or any
commissioner for taking affidavits for use in
any court in Canada, or by the collector of
tolls and dues. R.S., c. 138, s. 5.

## LIEN FOR TOLLS

**6.** (1) All tolls and dues chargeable for the
transmission of timber, lumber or saw-logs
through or over any works shall be a first
charge or lien on all or any part of such
timber, lumber or saw-logs.
(2) Every portion of any such timber,
lumber or saw-logs so transmitted is liable for
the whole or any portion of such tolls and
dues wherever and so long as the same is
found and whether it is or is not converted
into deals or boards ; but no part of any such
timber, lumber, saw-logs or the product thereof
bona fide sold, assigned, or transferred is, in
addition to the costs, if any, incurred in
enforcing the claim for such tolls or dues,
liable for more than double the tolls or dues
that it would proportionately to, and as a
part of, the whole of such timber, lumber or
saw-logs have been liable to, in case such tolls
and dues were being realized from the whole
of such timber, lumber or saw-logs. R.S., c.
138, s. 6.

**7.** All officers or agents, employed in the
collection of tolls and dues, and all persons
acting under the authority of such officers or
agents may follow any timber in respect of
which tolls or dues are chargeable and may
seize and detain the timber wherever it is
found, until the tolls and dues thereon are
paid or secured, as provided by this Act or by
the regulations. R.S., c. 138, s. 7.

**8.** In case of the Crown having any claim
or lien under this Act on any timber, lumber
or saw-logs or on any sawn lumber whether
such claim or lien in respect to such sawn
lumber was originally on such sawn lumber or
on timber, lumber or saw-logs out of which
the same was sawn, no transfer, assignment,
sale, mortgage or delivery to any person or
any change of owner affects in any respect
such claim or lien, saving always the right of
any innocent holder of any remedy he has at
law against the person from whom he received
any such timber, lumber, saw-logs or sawn
lumber. R.S., c. 138, s. 8.

**9.** Where any timber, lumber or saw-logs,
in respect of which tolls or dues are chargeable,
have been converted into sawn lumber and
placed in any yard or piling ground with
other sawn lumber, in such a way that the
identity thereof cannot be ascertained, all the
sawn lumber in such yard or piling ground
shall be deemed to be the product of timber,
lumber or saw-logs that have passed over or
through works to which this Act applies, and
is liable for all tolls and dues with which the
timber, lumber or saw-logs, the product of
which has been so placed with other sawn
lumber in such yard or piling ground, are
chargeable. R. S., c. 138, s. 9.

## COLLECTION OF TOLLS

**10.** Where any timber, lumber or saw-logs,
or product thereof, seized and detained for
non-payment of tolls, dues, penalties, expenses
and costs remains more than thirty days in
the custody of the collector or person
appointed to guard the same, without the
tolls, dues, penalties and expenses being paid,
the Minister may order a sale of the said
timber, lumber or saw-logs, or product thereof,
to be made after such notice as he deems
sufficient ; and the balance of the proceeds of
such sale, after retaining the amount of tolls,
dues, penalties and expenses incurred, shall
be paid to the owner or person lawfully
claiming such timber, lumber or saw-logs, or
product thereof ; and if a sufficient sum is not
realized from such sale to defray such tolls,
dues, penalties and expenses, the amount
remaining unpaid is recoverable, with costs,
in any court of competent jurisdiction, by the
collector of tolls and dues in his own name,
or in the name of Her Majesty ; but the whole
amount of tolls and penalties is recoverable
in like manner, with costs, from the owner or
person in possession of such timber, lumber or
saw-logs, or product thereof, by the collector
of tolls and dues, if he, with the permission
of the Minister, chooses that method of
collection. R.S., c. 138, s. 10.
1 1. Any officer or person who seizes timber,
lumber or saw-logs, or any product thereof, in
the discharge of his duty under this Act may,
in the name of Her Majesty, call in any
assistance necessary for securing and protect
ing the property so seized. R.S., c. 138, s. 11.

**12.** All collectors of customs, officers of
canals, and all other Government officers,
when requested so to do, shall cooperate with
the collector of tolls and dues and his
assistants, with the view of preventing the
transport of timber, lumber or saw-logs, and
the products thereof, until the tolls and dues
thereon are secured. R.S., c. 138, s. 12.

## BURDEN OF PROOF

**13.** When any timber, lumber or saw-logs,
or product thereof, are seized for non-payment
of tolls, dues or penalties or any prosecution
is brought for tolls, dues or penalties under
this Act, and any question arises whether the
tolls, dues or penalties have been paid on
such timber, lumber or saw-logs, or product
thereof, or whether the same are liable to
tolls, dues or penalties for having used the
works in respect of which the same are
charged, the burden of proving payment or
that the works were not used, lies on the
owner or person claiming such timber, lumber
or saw-logs, or product thereof, and not on
the officer seizing the same or instituting such
prosecution. U.S., c. 138, s. 13.

## RELEASE ON SECURITY

**14.** The collector of tolls and dues may,
with the sanction of the Minister, release from
seizure any timber, lumber or saw-logs, or
product thereof, seized under this Act, and
deliver the same to the alleged owner, on
receiving security by bond, with two good and
sufficient sureties, satisfactory to him, to pay
double the amount claimed as chargeable in
respect of such timber, lumber or saw-logs, or
product thereof ; and such bond shall be taken
in the name of Her Majesty ; and if such
seizure is maintained by competent authority,
the amount actually due, with interest and
costs, shall be paid forthwith to the proper
officer, otherwise the penalty of such bond
shall be enforced and recovered. R.S., c. 138,
s. 14.

## RETURNS BY RAILWAYS

**15.** All managers and officers of railways,
when requested by the collector of tolls and
dues so to do, shall render a correct account
of all timber, lumber and saw-logs that are
being forwarded by their respective railways,
stating kinds and quantities, and specifying
the owners thereof or by whom the same are
sent. R.S., c. 138, s. 15.

**16.** Where any such manager or officer
refuses or neglects to give the information
required by this Act, the collector of tolls and
dues or person acting for him may, if he has
reasonable cause to believe that the tolls and
dues thereon have not been paid, seize and
detain such timber, lumber or saw-logs,
together with the cars employed in removing
are not liable for any such tolls or dues ; and
the Minister may, in his discretion, order the
same, when so forfeited, to be sold. R.S., c.
138, s. 16.

## OFFENCES AND PENALTIES

**17.** Every manager or officer of any
railway who refuses or neglects to give the
information required by this Act, or who gives
false information, shall incur a penalty not
exceeding five hundred dollars and not less
than one hundred dollars. R.S., c. 138, s. 17.

**18.** All fines and pecuniary penalties
imposed by this Act or by any regulation
made under this Act shall be recoverable in
any court of competent jurisdiction. R.S., c.
138, s. 18.

**19.** All pecuniary penalties imposed by
any regulation made under this Act may be
recovered by the collector of tolls and dues
on summary conviction. R.S., c. 138, s. 19.
