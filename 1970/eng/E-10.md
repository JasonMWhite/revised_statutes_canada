c. 307, s. 3.

**4.** (1) Every person charged with an
offence, and, except as otherwise provided in
this section, the wife or husband, as the case
may be, of the person so charged, is a
competent witness for the defence, whether
the person so charged is charged solely or
jointly with any other person.
(2) The wife or husband of a person charged
with an offence against section 33 or 34 of the

person.
(5) The failure of the person charged, or of
the wife or husband of such person, to testify,
shall not be made the subject of comment by
the judge, or by counsel for the prosecution.
R.S., c. 307, s. 4 ; 1953-54, c. 51, s. 749.

**5.** (1) No witness shall be excused from
answering any question upon the ground that
the answer to such question may tend to
criminate him, or may tend to establish his
liability to a civil proceeding at the instance
of the Crown or of any person.
(2) Where with respect to any question a
witness objects to answer upon the ground
that his answer may tend to criminate him,
or may tend to establish his liability to a civil
proceeding at the instance of the Crown or of
any person, and if but for this Act, or the Act
of any provincial legislature, the witness
would therefore have been excused from
answering such question, then although the
witness is by reason of this Act, or by reason
of such provincial Act, compelled to answer,
the answer so given shall not be used or
receivable in evidence against him in any
criminal trial, or other criminal proceeding
against him thereafter taking place, other
than a prosecution for perjury in the giving
of such evidence. R.S., c. 307, s. 5.

**6.** A witness who is unable to speak may
give his evidence in any other manner in
which he can make it intelligible. R.S., c. 307,
s. 6.

criminal or civil, it is intended by the

or judge or person presiding. R.S., c.

any writing proved to the satisfaction of the
court to be genuine shall be permitted to be

the evidence of witnesses respecting such
writings, may be submitted to the court and
jury as proof of the genuineness or otherwise
of the writing in dispute. R.S., c. 307, s. 8.

**9.** (1) A party producing a witness shall
not be allowed to impeach his credit by
general evidence of bad character, but if the
witness, in the opinion of the court, proves
adverse, such party may contradict him by
other evidence, or, by leave of the court, may
prove that the witness made at other times a
statement inconsistent with his present tes
timony ; but before such last mentioned proof
can be given the circumstances of the supposed
statement, sufficient to designate the particu
lar occasion, shall be mentioned to the witness,
and he shall be asked whether or not he did
make such statement.
(2) Where the party producing a witness
alleges that the witness made at other times
a statement in writing, or reduced to writing,
inconsistent with his present testimony, the
court may, without proof that the witness is
adverse, grant leave to that party to cross-
examine the witness as to the statement and
the court may consider such cross-examination
in determining whether in the opinion of the
court the witness is adverse. R.S., c. 307, s. 9;
1968-69, c. 14, s. 2.

**10.** (1) Upon any trial a witness may be
cross-examined as to previous statements
made by him in writing, or reduced to writing,
relative to the subject-matter of the case,
without such writing being shown to him ;
but, if it is intended to contradict the witness
by the writing, his attention must, before such
contradictory proof can be given, be called to
those parts of the writing that are to be used
for the purpose of so contradicting him ; the
at any time during the trial, may
require the production of the writing for his
inspection, and thereupon make such use of
it for the purposes of the trial as he thinks
fit.
(2) A deposition of the witness, purporting
to have been taken before a justice on the
investigation of a criminal charge and to be
signed by the witness and the justice, returned
to and produced from the custody of the
proper officer, shall be presumed prima facie
to have been signed by the witness. R.S., c.
307, s. 10.

**11.** Where a witness upon cross-examina
tion as to a former statement made by him
relative to the subject-matter of the case and
inconsistent with his present testimony, does
not distinctly admit that he did make such
statement, proof may be given that he did in
fact make it ; but before such proof can be
given the circumstances of the supposed
statement, sufficient to designate the particu
lar occasion, shall be mentioned to the witness,
and he shall be asked whether or not he did
make such statement. R.S., c. 307, s. 11.

**12.** (1) A witness may be questioned as to
whether he has been convicted of any offence,
and upon being so questioned, if he either
denies the fact or refuses to answer, the
opposite party may prove such conviction.
(2) The conviction may be proved by
producing
  * (_a_) a certificate containing the substance
and effect only, omitting the formal part,
of the indictment and conviction, if it is for
an indictable offence, or a copy of the
summary conviction, if for an offence
punishable upon summary conviction, pur
porting to be signed by the clerk of the
court or other officer having the custody of
the records of the court in which the
conviction, if upon indictment, was had, or
to which the conviction, if summary, was
returned ; and
(6) proof of identity. R.S., c. 307, s. 12.
Oaths and affirmations

**13.** Every court and judge, and every
having, by law or consent of parties,
authority to hear and receive evidence, has
power to administer an oath to every witness
who is legally called to give evidence before
that court, judge or person. R.S., c. 307, s. 13.

**14.** (1) Where a person called or desiring
to give evidence objects, on grounds of
conscientious scruples, to take an oath, or is
objected to as incompetent to take an oath,
such person may make the following affirma
tion:
I solemnly affirm that the evidence to be given by me
shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the
truth.
(2) Upon the person making such solemn
affirmation, his evidence shall be taken and
have the same effect as if taken under oath.
R.S., c. 307, s. 14.

**15.** (1) Where a person required or desiring
to make an affidavit or deposition in a
proceeding or on an occasion whereon or
concerning a matter respecting which an oath
is required or is lawful, whether on the taking
of office or otherwise, refuses or is unwilling
to be sworn, on grounds of conscientious
scruples, the court or judge, or other officer
or person qualified to take affidavits or
depositions, shall permit such person, instead
of being sworn, to make his solemn affirmation
in the words following, namely: "I, A.B., do
solemnly affirm, etc."; and this solemn
affirmation shall be of the same force and
effect as if such person had taken an oath in
the usual form.
(2) Any witness whose evidence is admitted
or who makes an affirmation under this
section or section 14 is liable to indictment
and punishment for perjury in all respects as
if he had been sworn. R.S., c. 307, s. 15.

**16.** (1) In any legal proceeding where a
child of tender years is offered as a witness,
and such child does not, in the opinion of the
judge, justice or other presiding officer,
understand the nature of an oath , the evidence
of such child may be received, though not
given upon oath, if, in the opinion of the
judge, justice or other presiding officer, as the
case may be, the child is possessed of sufficient
intelligence to justify the reception of the
evidence, and understands the duty of
speaking the truth.
(2) No case shall be decided upon such
evidence alone, and it must be corroborated
by some other material evidence. R.S., c. 307,
s. 16.
Judicial Notice

**17.** Judicial notice shall be taken of all
Acts of the Imperial Parliament, of all
ordinances made by the Governor in Council,
