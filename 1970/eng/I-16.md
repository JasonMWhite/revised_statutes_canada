## CHAPTER I- 16
An Act respecting foreign insurance companies
in Canada
WHEREAS the Parliament of Canada has
jurisdiction, by properly framed legislation,
to prohibit aliens, whether natural persons or
foreign companies, from carrying on the
business of insurance in Canada without a
licence ; and
WHEREAS certain sections of the Insurance
Act, chapter 101 of the Revised Statutes of
Canada, 1927, requiring foreign insurance
companies to obtain a licence as a condition
of carrying on business in Canada, have been
declared, in view of their relation to other
provisions of the said Act, to be not properly
framed and, therefore, unconstitutional; and
WHEREAS foreign insurance companies are
soliciting applications for and issuing life
insurance policies as protection and long term
investments of the savings of their policy-
holders in Canada, and such companies now
have outstanding more than four million four
hundred thousand policies in Canada to an
aggregate amount of more than two billions
of dollars; and
WHEREAS foreign insurance companies,
associations and exchanges now have insur
ance in force against the destruction of
property in Canada by fire to an amount of
more than four and a quarter billions of
dollars, and insurance providing for the
payment of large sums dependent on other
contingencies; and
WHEREAS such insurance constitutes an
important factor in the international trade
and commercial relations of Canada; and
WHEREAS certain foreign insurance compa
nies and exchanges have in times past become
insolvent while carrying on business in
Canada, and the policyholders in Canada
thereof would have sustained serious losses
but for provisions in the then existing
legislation that required such companies and
exchanges to deposit assets in Canada as
security for their liabilities in Canada, and to
make returns as to their business and financial
standing, and to submit to inspection by
representatives of the Government ; and
WHEREAS foreign insurance companies,
associations and exchanges, transacting the
business of insurance throughout Canada,
receive each year from policyholders in
Canada many millions of dollars in premiums,
and incur liabilities to such policyholders
requiring involved actuarial and other com
putations for their determination, and the
ability or inability of such companies, associa
tions and exchanges to discharge such liabili
ties, as they become due, is dependent upon
the character and value of their assets
available for such purpose ; and
WHEREAS it is contrary to the public interest
that such foreign insurance companies,
associations and exchanges that are unable to
discharge their liabilities to policyholders in
Canada as they become due, or are otherwise
insolvent, should be permitted to carry on the
business of insurance in Canada ; and
WHEREAS it is desirable to provide, by a
system of registration, deposit of securities,
inspection and returns, against such foreign
companies, associations or exchanges engaging
in or continuing to carry on business in
Canada while unable to discharge their
liabilities to such policyholders as they become
due or while otherwise insolvent and to
declare the conditions upon which such
companies, associations and exchanges shall
be deemed to be insolvent and be subject to
be wound up under the Winding-up Act;
THEREFORE, His Majesty, by and with the
advice and consent of the Senate and House
of Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:

of the company s policyholders in Canada
will not be prejudiced thereby, authorize the
withdrawal of the amount of such excess or
any portion thereof. R.S., c. 125, s. 18.

trust for the purposes of this Act are those set

shall be open to public inspection;
  * (_b_) in each case, before the granting of any
certificate of registry or the renewal of any

the statement of the affairs of the company
it is in a condition to meet its liabilities;

registry as they are issued;
  * (_d_) visit personally, or cause a duly qualified
member of his staff to visit, the chief agency

and examine the statements of the condition
and affairs of the Canadian business of

Minister as to all matters requiring his
attention and decision ; but where in the
opinion of the Superintendent the circum
stances so warrant in the case of any
company, he may make such examination
less frequently than annually but not less
frequently than once in every three years ;
each company. R.S., c. 125, s. 27.

**28.** (1) When the Superintendent, after an
examination into the condition and affairs of
any company registered to transact business
in Canada, as disclosed by the annual or
other statements furnished by the company
to the Minister or for any other reason, deems
it necessary or expedient to make a further
examination into the affairs of the company,
and so reports to the Minister, the Minister
may, in his discretion, instruct the Superin
tendent to visit the chief agency of the
company, thoroughly to inspect and examine
into all its affairs, and to make all such
further inquiries as are necessary to ascertain
its condition and ability to meet its obliga
tions, and whether it has complied with all
the provisions of this Act.

and shall otherwise facilitate such examina
tion so far as it is in their power.

**32.** (1) Where upon an examination of the
assets of any company it appears to the
Superintendent that the value placed by the
company upon the real estate owned by it in
Canada or any parcel thereof is too great, he
may either request the company to procure
an appraisal of such real estate by one or
more competent valuators, or may himself
procure an appraisal at the company s
expense, and the appraised value, if it is
materially less than that shown in the return
made by the company, may be substituted
for the latter in the annual report prepared
for the Minister by the Superintendent.
(2) Where it appears to the Superintendent
^ e amount f anv l an secured by
mortgage or hypothec upon any parcel of real
estate in Canada, together with the interest

under the policy, or a lump sum disability
indemnity in respect of total and permanent
disability which, together with any other
disability indemnity otherwise at any time
paid under the policy, shall not exceed the
said sum assured, and in a deferred annuity
contract a disability indemnity not exceed
ing the rate of annuity provided by the
contract ;

the life insurance money is payable in one
sum, or the commuted value of the income or
instalments provided upon death where the
life insurance money is payable otherwise
than in one sum, but not including any
additional sum payable under the policy on
death as a result of accident.

to transact the business of life insurance may,
if its charter empowers it to do so, but subject
to this section, transact the classes of insurance
enumerated in paragraphs (2)(a),(6),(c) and
(d).
(5) If a company in the exercise of its
powers issues policies in Canada such that the
reserves therefor to be included in the annual
statement pursuant to section 38 vary in
amount depending upon the market value of
a specified group of assets, the company shall
maintain in respect of such policies one or
more separate and distinct funds with separate
assets for each such fund.
(6) Where a separate and distinct fund with
separate assets is maintained pursuant to
subsection (5), the assets of the fund so
maintained shall be available only to meet
the liabilities arising under policies in respect
of which such fund is maintained, except that

distinct fund from other funds of the company
may, subject to the approval of the Superin
tendent, be withdrawn from the separate and
distinct fund and transferred to such other
funds as the directors may determine.
(7) Subject to subsection (8), where a
separate and distinct fund with separate assets
is maintained by a company with respect to
any policies in Canada, the percentage limits
specified in sections 4, 6 and 7 of Schedule I
apply to the investments and loans constitut
ing the assets in Canada of the fund as if
those assets were the total assets in Canada
of the company.
(8) Where the policies in respect of which a
separate and distinct fund with separate assets
is maintained are such that the liabilities
therefor to be included in the annual statement
pursuant to section 38 vary in amount
depending upon the market value of the
assets of the fund, the percentage limits
specified in sections 6 and 7 of Schedule I do
not apply to the assets in Canada constituting
the assets of the fund and, in the application
of those limits to the total assets in Canada
the company, the assets in Canada of any
separate fund shall not be taken into

## SCHEDULE II

## RESERVE FOR ALL UNMATURED

## OBLIGATIONS

**1.** In computing the reserve for all unmatured obligations
guaranteed under the terms of the policies dependent on life
contingencies only, the valuation shall be made in accordance
with the following prescriptions, namely:
  * (_a_) the rate of interest assumed shall not exceed the rate
prescribed in the annex to this schedule or such higher rate
as may be authorized by the Superintendent for a particular
class of policies issued by any company on application to the
Superintendent by the company accompanied by evidence
satisfactory to the Superintendent that the higher rate is
appropriate for that class of policies ; and the Superintendent
may at any time withdraw such authorization;
(6) the tables of mortality used shall be the tables pre
scribed in the annex, subject to any modification in the age
that the company may deem appropriate and necessary to
secure the proper valuation of a particular class of policies
and that has the effect of increasing the reserves, but if it
appears to a company that the reserves for a particular
class of policies cannot be appropriately computed by any
table of mortality prescribed in the annex or by any such
table modified as aforesaid, the company shall apply to the
Superintendent for approval of the table the company deems
most appropriate for the computation;
  * (_c_) the method of valuation shall be that specified in the
annex or any adaptation thereof approved by the Super
intendent under the provisions of this schedule, or any other
method the company deems appropriate; but the method
used shall be such that the reserve calculated in accordance
therewith shall not be less at any duration than the reserve
computed in accordance with the valuation provisions in the
annex, and the method shall make adequate provision for
the guaranteed values at the subsequent durations of the
policy according to the rate of interest and the table of
mortality used in the valuation; and
  * (_d_) the reserve in the first policy year need not in any
event exceed the reserve computed in accordance with the
rate of interest and table of mortality used in the valuation
and the method of valuation described in the annex.

**2.** In computing the reserve for all unmatured obligations,
guaranteed under the terms of or arising out of policies, depen
dent on contingencies other than life contingencies only, the
bases and methods of valuation employed by the company
shall be such as to place an adequate value on the liabilities
thereunder, and shall be such that the value of the benefits
under each and every policy shall in no case be less than the
value placed upon the future premiums.

**3.** There shall be included in the annual statement a certi
ficate by the actuary of the company, or by the actuary
responsible for the valuation if the company has no actuary,
to the effect that the reserves shown in the valuation sum
mary are not less than the reserves required by the provisions
of this schedule, and in addition that in his opinion the
reserves make a good and sufficient provision for all unmatured
obligations of the company guaranteed under the terms of
its policies.

**4.** Where it appears to the Superintendent that the reserve
included in the liabilities in the annual statement of any com
pany has not been computed in accordance with the provisions
of the preceding sections of this schedule, he shall make known
to the company in what respects in his opinion the valuation
does not comply with the said provisions with a view to having
such alterations made in the valuation as may be necessary to
secure compliance with those provisions, and on failure of the
company to have such alterations made the company shall
furnish to the Superintendent on request, the full particulars
of its policies necessary for computation of the reserve required
in accordance with the provisions of the preceding sections of
this schedule, and the reserve so computed by the Superinten
dent shall be substituted in the liabilities in the annual
statement for the reserve computed by the company.

**5.** Once in every five years or oftener at the discretion of
the Minister, the Superintendent shall himself value or cause
to be valued under his supervision all the policies in Canada
of every company, and any such valuation shall be made on
the bases and in accordance with the methods the company
purports to use in computing the reserve included in the
liabilities in the annual statement of the company made as of
the valuation date, or if the valuation is made as of a date
other than the annual statement date, then in the annual
statement of the company last made preceding the date of
valuation, subject to such alterations as may be made in the
reserve under section 4 of this schedule.

**6.** Instead of making a valuation as provided under section 5
of this schedule, the Superintendent may satisfy himself by
an examination of the valuation made by the company whether
the company is maintaining the reserve it purports to maintain
and whether the reserve maintained complies with the provi
sions of this schedule.

**7.** In any case where the Superintendent approves of a
table of mortality under the provisions of this schedule he
shall include in his annual report to the Minister such infor
concerning the origin and characteristics of the table
the circumstances in which it may be used as the Super
deems necessary and appropriate; and approval
Superintendent.
