## CALCULATION OF ADJUSTMENT

**3.** (1) Subject to this Act, the annual rate
of the pension payable to a recipient whose
pension does not exceed the annual rate
specified in column 2 of Schedule III for the
class to which that recipient belongs is
increased by an amount equal to the lesser of
  * (_a_) the amount obtained by multiplying
  * (_i_) the annual rate of the pension payable
to the recipient, or
  * (_ii_) the annual rate specified in column 1
of Schedule III for the class to which the
recipient belongs,
whichever is the lesser, by the figure in
columns 2 to 7 of Schedule II that is
appropriate to the salary basis on which the
pension of the recipient is calculated and is
opposite the latest period of service of the
employee, to or in respect of whom the
pension is payable, as set out in column 1
of the said Schedule, that was used to
calculate the pension ; and
(6) an amount equal to the amount remain
ing after subtracting the annual rate of the
pension payable to that recipient from the
annual rate specified in column 2 of
Schedule III for the class to which the
recipient belongs.
(2) Where the pension of a recipient was
calculated on the average annual salary
the pension is payable during the
of pensionable service to that
s credit, but would, if that employee
had ten years or more pensionable service,
been calculated on the basis of the
average annual salary received by him during
a ten year period, the pension of that recipient
shall, for the purposes of this Act, be deemed
to be calculated on a ten year average salary
basis. 1959, c. 32, s. 3.

**4.** Where a recipient is in receipt of more
than one pension and the total annual rate
of the pensions payable to that recipient
exceeds the annual rate specified in column 2
of Schedule III for the class to which the
recipient belongs, no increase shall be made
pursuant to this Act in any of the pensions
payable to that recipient. 1959, c. 32, s. 4.

**5.** (i) Subject to subsection (2), where a
rec ipi ent is in receipt of two pensions and the
total annual rate of both pensions does not
exceed the annual rate specified in column 2
of Schedule III for the class to which the
recipient belongs, each pension of that
recipient shall be increased in accordance with
the following rules :
  * (_a_) if the annual rate of the first pension of
the recipient is equal to or greater than the
annual rate specified in column 1 of
Schedule III for the class to which the
recipient belongs, the annual rate of the
first pension of that recipient shall be
increased in accordance with the formula
set out in section 3, and no increase shall
be made in the annual rate of the second
pension of the recipient ;
  * (_b_) if the aggregate of the annual rate of
the first and second pensions of the recipient
is less than the annual rate specified in
column 1 of Schedule III for the class to
which the recipient belongs, the annual rate
of each of the pensions of that recipient
shall be increased in accordance with the
formula set out in section 3 ; and
  * (_c_) if the annual rate of the first pension of
the recipient is less than the annual rate
specified in column 1 of Schedule III for
the class to which the recipient belongs, but
the aggregate of the annual rate of the first
and second pensions of the recipient exceeds
the annual rate specified in column 1 of
Schedule III for the class to which the
this paragraph the annual rate of the second
pension shall be deemed to be an amount
equal to the resultant obtained by subtract
ing from the annual rate specified in column
1 of Schedule III for the class to which the
recipient belongs, the annual rate of the
first pension of the recipient.
(2) No increase shall be made pursuant to
this section in the pension payable to a
recipient so that the aggregate of the annual
rate of both pensions of that recipient and
the increases thereto exceeds the annual rate
specified in column 2 of Schedule III for the
class to which the recipient belongs.
(3) In this section
"first pension" means the pension payable to
a recipient and calculated in respect of a
period of service that is earlier in time than
the latest period of service in respect of
which the other pension payable to that
recipient is calculated;
"second pension" means a pension payable to
a recipient other than a first pension. 1959.
c. 32, s. 5.

**6.** Where a recipient is in receipt of more
than two pensions and the total annual rate
of all the pensions payable to him does not
exceed the annual rate specified in column 2
of Schedule III for the class to which that
recipient belongs, each pension of that
recipient shall be increased by such amount
as the Treasury Board determines, but the
aggregate of the increases in the pensions
payable to that recipient shall not exceed an
annual amount equal to the lesser of
  * (_a_) the maximum annual increase specified
in column 3 of Schedule III for the class to
which that recipient belongs : and
(6) the amount remaining after subtracting
the aggregate of the annual rate of all the
pensions payable to that recipient from the
annual rate specified in column 2 of
Schedule III for the class to which the
recipient belongs. 1959. c. 32, s. 6.

**7.** (1) Notwithstanding anything in this
where a recipient as an employee and as
widow of an employee is in receipt of two
more pensions
  * (_a_) if the total rate of all the pensions
payable to that recipient exceeds three
thousand dollars, no increase shall be made
in the annual rate of any of the pensions
payable to that recipient ; and
(6) if the total rate of all the pensions
payable to that recipient does not exceed
three thousand dollars, each pension shall,
subject to subsection (2), be increased in
accordance with the formula set out in
section 3.
(2) The aggregate of all increases made in
the pensions of a recipient described in
subsection (1) shall not exceed an annual
amount equal to the lesser of
  * (_a_) the amount remaining after subtracting
from three thousand dollars the aggregate
of the annual amount of the pensions
payable to the recipient ; and
(6) an amount determined by the Treasury
Board but in no case exceeding six hundred
and forty dollars. 1959, c. 32, s. 7.
