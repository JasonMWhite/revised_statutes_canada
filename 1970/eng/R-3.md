## DESIGNATION OF REGIONS

**3.** (1) Subject to subsection (2), the Gover
nor in Council, after consultation with the

designate as a designated region, for the
period set out in the order, any region,

provinces or any portion thereof not less than
5,000 square miles in size, that is determined
to require special measures to facilitate
economic expansion and social adjustment.

Council, upon the report of the Minister, is
satisfied that
  * (_a_) existing opportunities for productive
employment in the region are exceptionally
inadequate ; and
  * (_b_) the provision of development incentives
under this Act for the establishment of new

## DEVELOPMENT INCENTIVES
Authorization of Incentives

**4.** Upon application therefor to the Minis
subject to this Act and upon such
and conditions as are prescribed by the
of
  * (_a_) a primary development incentive by
way of financial assistance to the applicant
for the establishment, expansion or mod
ernization of the facility; and
(6) in the case of a proposal to establish a
new facility or to expand an existing facility
to enable the manufacturing or processing

or processed in the operation, a secondary
development incentive by way of additional
financial assistance to the applicant for the
establishment of the new facility or the
expansion of the existing facility for that
purpose. 1968-69, c. 56, s. 4.
Maximum Amounts

**5.** (1) The amount of a primary develop
ment incentive shall be based on the approved
capital costs of establishing, expanding or
modernizing the facility in respect of which
the primary development incentive is author
ized and shall not exceed
  * (_a_) 20% of those approved capital costs, or
  * (_b_) $6,000,000,
whichever is the lesser amount.
(2) The amount of a secondary development
incentive shall be based on the approved
capital costs of establishing or expanding the
facility in respect of which the secondary
development incentive is authorized and on
the number of jobs created directly in the
operation and shall not exceed
  * (_a_) 5% of those approved capital costs,
plus
  * (_b_) $5,000 for each job determined by the
Minister to have been created directly in
the operation.
(3) A secondary development incentive in
respect of any facility shall not exceed an
amount that, when added to the amount of
the primary development incentive authorized
in respect of that facility, would result in a
combined development incentive that exceeds
  * (_a_) $30,000 for each job determined by the
Minister to have been created directly in
the operation,
(6) $12,000,000, or
  * (_c_) one-half of the capital to be employed
in the operation,
is the least amount. 1968-69, c. 56,
s. 5.
Determination of Amount of Incentive

**6.** Subject to this Act, the Minister may
authorize the provision of a development
incentive in the maximum amount provided
for by this Act or in any lesser amount, and
in determining whether to authorize the
provision of a development incentive in the
maximum amount so provided for or in any
lesser amount, the Minister shall take into
consideration the following factors:
  * (_a_) the extent of the contribution that the
establishment, expansion or modernization
of the facility would make to economic
expansion and social adjustment in the
designated region ;
(6) the probable cost to provincial, munici
pal or other public authorities of providing
services or utilities required for or in
connection with the facility;
  * (_c_) the amount or present value of any
federal, provincial or municipal assistance
given or to be given, other than under this
Act, in respect of the establishment, expan
sion or modernization of the facility ;
  * (_d_) the probable cost of preventing or
eliminating any significant air, water or
other pollution that could result from the
establishment, expansion or modernization
of the facility ;
  * (_e_) in the case of any proposal to establish
or expand a facility constituting the
necessary components of a processing oper
ation, whether the resources to be exploited
would be adequate, on a sustained-yield
basis, to support the facility together with
existing facilities that utilize the same
resources ; and
  * (_f_) such other factors relating to the eco
nomic and social benefits and costs of the
facility as the Minister considers relevant.
1968-69, c. 56, s. 6.
Ineligible Facilities

**7.** (1) No development incentive may be
if, in the opinion of the Minister,
  * (_a_) it is probable that the facility would be
established, expanded or modernized with
out the provision of such an incentive ; or
(6) the establishment, expansion or mod
ernization of the facility would not make a
significant contribution to economic expan
sion and social adjustment within the
designated region.
(2) No development incentive may be
authorized under this Act for the establish
ment, expansion or modernization of any
facility the capital costs of which would not,
in the opinion of the Minister, exceed such
minimum amount as is prescribed by the
regulations. 1968-69, c. 56, s. 7.
Limiting Provisions

**8.** (1) In calculating the amount of any
development incentive for the establishment,

there may be included in the approved capital
costs of establishing, expanding or moderniz
ing the facility any capital expenditures made
by the applicant to provincial, municipal or
other public authorities for the provision of
services or utilities required for or in connec
tion with the facility, if the Minister is of the
opinion that the expenditures were reasonably
and responsibly made, but no such expendi
tures shall be so included in excess of 20% of
the total amount of the approved capital costs
of establishing, expanding or modernizing the
facility, after deducting from those approved
capital costs all federal, provincial and
municipal grants or other financial assistance
made or to be made in connection therewith
or for which the applicant would ordinarily
have been eligible by reason of the establish
ment, expansion or modernization of the
facility.
(2) In calculating the amount of any
secondary development incentive for the
expansion of any facility, there may be
included in the capital to be employed in the
operation only such part of that capital as is
to be employed in connection with the
manufacturing or processing of a product not
previously manufactured or processed in the
1968-69, c. 56, s. 8.

**9.** (1) No development incentive may be
authorized under this Act for the establish
ment, expansion or modernization of a facility

(6) the day on which an application for the
development incentive is received by the
Minister,
whichever is the later date.

an application for a development incentive is
received by the Minister before the 1st day of
