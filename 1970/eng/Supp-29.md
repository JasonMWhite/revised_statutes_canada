## PART I

## LIABILITY FOR NUCLEAR

## INCIDENTS
Duty of Operator

**3.** Subject to this Act, an operator is
under a duty to secure that no injury to
any other person or damage to any prop
erty of any other person is occasioned as
a result of the fissionable or radioactive
properties, or a combination of any of those
properties with toxic, explosive or other
hazardous properties, of
  * (_a_) nuclear material that is in the nu
clear installation of which he is the op
erator,
  * (_b_) nuclear material that, having been in
the nuclear installation of which he is the
operator, has not subsequently been in a
nuclear installation operated under law
ful authority by any other person, or
  * (_c_) nuclear material that is in the course
of carriage from outside Canada to the
nuclear installation of which he is the
operator or is in a place of storage inci
dental to that carriage.
Absolute Liability of Operator

**4.** Subject to this Act, an operator is,
without proof of fault or negligence, abso
lutely liable for a breach of the duty im
posed upon him by this Act.

**5.** Where liability under this Act in re
spect of the same injury or damage is in
curred by two or more operators, the
liability of the operators shall, to the extent
that the injury or damage attributable to a
breach of the duty imposed on each of them
by this Act is not reasonably separable, be
treated as joint and several.

**6.** Injury or damage that, though not
attributable to a breach of the duty im-
posed upon an operator by this Act, is not
reasonably separable from injury or dam-
age that is attributable to a breach of that
dut y sha11 be deemed &amp;gt; for the purposes of
this Act, to be attributable to that breach
of duty.
Exceptions

**7.** An operator is not liable for injury or
damage of the kind described in section 3
if the nuclear incident resulting in such
. . . . .
injury or damage occurred as a direct re
sult of an act of armed conflict in the
course of war, invasion or insurrection.

**8.** An operator is not liable for injury or
damage suffered by any person if the
nuclear incident resulting in such injury or
damage occurred wholly or partly as a
result of an unlawful act or omission of
that person done or omitted to be done with
intent to cause injury or damage.

**9.** (1) Where a nuclear incident occurs
at a nuclear installation, the operator
thereof is not liable for damage caused by
the nuclear incident to the nuclear installa
tion, to property on the premises of the
nuclear installation that is used or to be
used in connection with the nuclear instal
lation, or to the ship, aircraft or other
means of transportation of which the nu
clear installation forms part of the equip
ment.
(2) Where a nuclear incident occurs in
the course of the carriage of nuclear mate
rial or while such material is in storage
incidental to its carriage, an operator is
not liable for damage to the means of car
riage or to the place where the material is
stored.
Limitations

**11.** Except as otherwise provided by or
pursuant to this Act, no person is liable for
any injury or damage attributable to a
breach of the duty imposed upon an opera
tor by this Act.

operator;
  * (_ii_) any scheme or system of health or
hospitalization insurance, employees
compensation or occupational disease
compensation; or
  * (_iii_) any survivorship or disability
provision of or governing any super
annuation or pension fund or plan ; or
  * (_b_) where a nuclear incident resulting in
any injury or damage of the kind de
scribed in section 3 occurred wholly or
partly as a result of an unlawful act or
omission of any person done or omitted
to be done with intent to cause injury or
damage, any right of recourse of an
operator against that person.

**13.** No action under this Part shall be
brought
  * (_a_) in the case of a claim for injury
other than loss of life, or for damage to
property, after three years from the
earliest date upon which the person mak
ing the claim had knowledge or ought
reasonably to have had knowledge of the
injury or damage, or
(6) in the case of a claim for loss of life,
  * (_i_) after three years from the date of
the death of the person for whose loss
of life the claim is made, or
  * (_ii_) where conclusive evidence of the
death of that person is not available,
after three years from the date an
order presuming the person to be dead
is made by a court having jurisdiction
in such matters,
and in no case shall any such action be
brought after ten years from the date the
cause of action arose.
Jurisdiction of Courts

**14.** (1) An action under this Part shall

diction and that exercises jurisdiction
  * (_a_) in the place where the injury or
damage resulting from the nuclear inci
dent in respect of which the action is
brought was occasioned, or
  * (_b_) where the nuclear incident in re
spect of which the action is brought re
sulted in injury or damage occasioned
in places in which more than one court
would otherwise have jurisdiction under
this subsection, in the place where the
nuclear installation at or in relation to
which the nuclear incident occurred was
situated or, in the case of a nuclear in
stallation that formed part of the equip
ment of a ship, aircraft or other means of
transportation, was declared to be situa
ted for the purposes of this section by the
licence described in the definition "op
erator" in section 2 relating to that nu
clear installation,
and that court, for the purpose of any
question raised in the action relating to
the place where the injury or damage was
