by a person who has an intent to commit an
offence is or is not mere preparation to
commit the offence, and too remote to

to
of
a person who is in custody by reason that he
is charged with or has been convicted of an
offence, to have the legality of his imprison
ment determined, the judge or court may,
without determining the question, make an
order for the further detention of that person
and direct the judge, justice or magistrate
under whose warrant he is in custody, or any
other judge, justice or magistrate to take any
proceedings, hear such evidence or do any
other thing that, in the opinion of the judge
or court, will best further the ends of justice.
1968-69, c. 38, s. 81.

**710.** No conviction or order shall be
removed by certiorari
  * (_a_) where an appeal was taken, whether or
not the appeal has been carried to a
conclusion, or
  * (_b_) where the defendant appeared and
pleaded and the merits were tried, and an
appeal might have been taken, but the
defendant did not appeal. 1953-54, c. 51,
s. 682.

**711.** (1) No conviction, order or warrant
for enforcing a conviction or order shall, on
being removed by certiorari, be held to be

the question is raised, upon perusal of the
evidence, is satisfied
  * (_a_) that an offence of the nature described
in the conviction, order or warrant, as the
case may be, was committed,
(6) that there was jurisdiction to make the
conviction or order or issue the warrant, as
the case may be, and
  * (_c_) that the punishment imposed, if any,
was not in excess of the punishment that
might lawfully have been imposed,
but the court or judge has the same powers to
deal with the proceedings in the manner that
he considers proper that are conferred upon a
court to which an appeal might have been
taken.
(2) Where, in proceedings to which subsec
but the punishment that was imposed
greater than the punishment that might
have been imposed, the court or
  * (_a_) shall correct the sentence,

imposing a fine that does not exceed the
maximum fine that might lawfully have
been imposed,
  * (_ii_) where the punishment is imprison
ment, and the person has not served a

imprisonment, by imposing a punishment
in accordance with subparagraph (i) or

impose a punishment that is not greater

imposed.

suant to subsection (1) or (2), the conviction
and warrant of committal, if any, shall be
amended to conform with the adjudication as
varied.

  * (_b_) the punishment imposed is less than the
punishment that might by law have been
imposed for the offence that appears by the
evidence to have been committed, or
  * (_c_) there has been an omission to negative
circumstances, the existence of which would
make the act complained of lawful, whether
exception or otherwise in the provision
under which the offence is charged, or are
stated in another provision. 1953-54, c. 51,
s. 684.
7x3. (i) A court that has authority to

before a judge or other officer, or has made a
deposit to be prescribed with a condition that
the defendant will prosecute the writ of
certiorari at his own expense, without wilful
delay, and, if ordered, will pay to the person

proceeding is affirmed, his full costs and
charges to be taxed according to the practice
of the court where the conviction, order or
proceeding is affirmed.

nizance entered into under this section. 1953-
54, c. 51,s.685.

order or other proceeding is refused, the order
of the court refusing the application is
sufficient authority for the clerk of the court
forthwith to return the conviction, order or
proceeding to the court from which or the
person from whom it was removed, and for
proceedings to be taken with respect thereto
for the enforcement thereof. 1953-54, c. 51,
s. 686.

warrant. 1953-54, c. 51, s. 688.

may in quashing the conviction, order or
other proceeding, order that no civil proceed
ings shall be taken against the justice or

under the conviction, order or other proceeding
or under any warrant issued to enforce it.

subjiciendum is granted by any judge no

tion, proviso, excuse or qualification does not
operate in favour of the defendant, whether
or not it is set out in the information. 1953-
54, c. 51,8.702.

**731.** No information, summons, convic
tion, order or process shall be deemed to

articles, either conjunctively or disjunctive
ly. 1953-54, c. 51, s. 703.

place.

the trial of an information, amend the
information or a particular that is furnished
under section 729, to make the information or
particular conform to the evidence if there
appears to be a variance between the evidence
and
  * (_a_) the charge in the information, or
(6) the charge in the information
  * (_i_) as amended, or
  * (_ii_) as it would have been if amended in
conformity with any particular that has
been furnished pursuant to section 729.
(3) A summary conviction court may, at
any stage of the trial, amend the information
as may be necessary if it appears
  * (_a_) that the information has been laid
  * (_i_) under another Act of the Parliament
of Canada instead of this Act, or
  * (_ii_) under this Act instead of another Act
of the Parliament of Canada ; or
(6) that the information
  * (_i_) fails to state or states defectively
anything that is requisite to constitute
the offence,
  * (_ii_) does not negative an exception that
should be negatived, or
  * (_iii_) is in any way defective in substance,
and the matters to be alleged in the
proposed amendment are disclosed by the
evidence taken on the trial ; or
  * (_c_) that the information is in any way
defective in form.
(4) A variance between the information and
the evidence taken on the trial is not material

  * (_a_) the time when the offence is alleged to
have been committed, if it is proved that
the information was laid within the pre
scribed period of limitation, or
(6) the place where the subject-matter of
the proceedings is alleged to have arisen, if
it is proved that it arose within the
territorial jurisdiction of the summary
conviction court that holds the trial.
(5) The summary conviction court shall, in
whether or not an amendment
be made, consider
  * (_a_) the evidence taken on the trial, if any,
(6) the circumstances of the case,
  * (_c_) whether the defendant has been misled
or prejudiced in his defence by a variance,
error or omission mentioned in subsection
(2) or (3), and
  * (_d_) whether, having regard to the merits of
the case, the proposed amendment can be
made without injustice being done.
(6) Where in the opinion of the summary
conviction court the defendant has been
misled or prejudiced in his defence by an
error or omission in the information, the
summary conviction court may adjourn the
trial and may make such an order with respect

necessity of amendment as it considers
desirable. 1953-54, c. 51, s. 704.

order should not be made against him, in
proceedings where a justice is authorized by

should not be made against him, as the case
may be, the summary conviction court shall

accordingly.

or states that he has cause to show why an
order should not be made against him, as the

provisions of Part XV relating to preliminary
