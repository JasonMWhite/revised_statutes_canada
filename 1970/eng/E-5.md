Act respecting emergency payments to
assist in meeting increased cost of pro
duction of gold

## SHORT TITLE
j. This Act may be cited as the Emergency
Gold Mining Assistance Act. R.S., c. 95, s. 1.

## INTERPRETATION

**2.** (1) In this Act
"average cost of production" of gold from a
mine during any period means the cost of
production of the gold produced from the
mine during that period divided by the
number of ounces of gold produced from
the mine during that period ;
"cost of production" of gold from a mine
during any period means the costs incurred
by the operator of the mine in, and properly
attributable to, the production of gold
produced from the mine during that period,
and includes mining, milling, smelting,
refining, transportation and administrative
costs so incurred and so attributable, and
includes such amounts in respect of deprecia
tion, amortization of pre-production
expenses, and costs of exploration and
development in the mine as may be
determined in accordance with the regula
tions, but does not include any amount in
respect of depletion or off-property explora
tion and development, or, subject to the
regulations, any amount in respect of any
matter for which a deduction is not allowed
in determining income from the mine for
the purposes of the Income Tax Act ;
year" means each of the calendar
years 1955 to 1970, both inclusive ;
year of production" means the period
of twelve months immediately following
the day on which the mine came into
production for the purposes of subsections
99(5) and (6) of the Income Tax Act, or, in
the case of a mine to which that section did
not or does not apply, the day the Minister
determines would have been the day on
which the mine came into production for
the purposes of that section if it had applied
to it;
"gold mine" and "mine" mean
  * (_a_) any work or undertaking in which ore
containing gold is mined and the gold
separated therefrom and refined, or
(6) any work or undertaking in which ore
containing gold is mined although the gold
is separated therefrom or refined, or both
separated therefrom and refined by a person
other than the person operating the work
or undertaking, under a contract with him
pursuant to which the gold produced
remains his property ;
"Minister" means the Minister of Energy,
Mines and Resources ;
"rate of assistance" for a mine for any period
means the amount that is two-thirds of the
amount by which the average cost of
production of gold from the mine during
the period exceeds twenty-six dollars and
fifty cents, but not in any event exceeding
twelve dollars and thirty-three cents.
(2) For the purposes of this Act
  * (_a_) a mine shall not be deemed to be a gold
mine during any designated year in which
the gold produced from the mine is less
than seventy per cent of the value of the
output of the mine ;
(6) the number of ounces of gold produced
from a mine during any period, means the
number of troy ounces of fine gold contained
in bullion that is produced from the mine
during that period ;
  * (_c_) all works or undertakings for the
production of gold operated by a person as
a unit and that include a mine, shall be
deemed to be one mine; but where a mill,
smelter or other like establishment is
operated by a person to mill, smelt, refine
or process ore containing gold, or material
produced therefrom, mined by him from
two or more works or undertakings each of
which is operated as a unit, the mill,
smelter, or other like establishment may,
with respect to its operations with regard to
such ore or material from each such work or
undertaking, be deemed by the Minister to
constitute, with each such work or under
taking, a separate mine ; and
  * (_d_) gold produced from a mine during a
designated year shall be deemed to be sold
during that designated year if it is sold as
soon as is practicable after the end of that
c. s. c. s. 1
year. R.S., 95, 2; 1955, 19, ; 1956,
c. 20, s. 1 ; 1958, c. 28, s. 1 ; 1960, c. 28, s. 2 ;

## ASSISTANCE PAYMENTS

**3.** (1) The Minister may pay to a person
engaged in operating a gold mine a sum not
exceeding an amount calculated in the manner
prescribed in this section with respect to gold
that is produced from the mine during a
designated year and that, during the desig
nated year,
  * (_a_) is sold to Her Majesty at the Royal
Canadian Mint, or
  * (_b_) is exported from Canada, in the form of
ore or ore concentrates containing gold, and
sold.
(2) The sum that may be paid in respect of
the gold produced from a mine and sold in a
designated year is
  * (_a_) in the case of a mine in which the first
year of production commenced prior to the
designated year, an amount equal to the
product of the rate of assistance for the
mine for that designated year multiplied
by two-thirds of the number of ounces of
gold produced from the mine and sold in
that designated year, and
  * (_b_) in the case of a mine in which the first
year of production commenced during the
designated year, an amount equal to the
product of the rate of assistance for the
mine for that designated year multiplied
by two-thirds of the number of ounces of
gold produced from the mine and sold in
that designated year after the commence
ment of the first year of production.
(3) Notwithstanding anything in this sec
tion, the amount of assistance that may be
paid in respect of gold produced and sold in
the designated years 1958 to 1970, both
inclusive, is the amount that may be paid
under the provisions of this Act other than
this subsection plus twenty-five per cent of
that amount. R.S., c. 318, s. 1 ; 1955, c. 19, s.
1; 1960, c. 28, s. 1; 1967-68, c. 17, s. 1.

**4.** This Act does not apply in respect of
gold produced from a mine and sold in any
calendar year where the mine was a lode gold
mine that did not come into production in
reasonable commercial quantities until after
June 1965, unless not less than fifty per cent
of the total number of persons employed at
the mine at any time during the calendar
year while the mine was in operation resided,
on the 12th day of December 1963, in one or
more communities in Canada specified in the
schedule or added to the schedule by any
regulation made pursuant to section 7. 1963,
c. 25, s. 2.

**5.** (1) The Minister may determine any
question that it is necessary to determine in
order to ascertain whether any payment may
be made to a person under this Act or the
amount of any such payment.
(2) Where it appears to the Minister that
the normal operation of a mine has not been
carried on during any period for the purpose
of reducing the production of gold from the
mine in that period and increasing the
production of gold from the mine in another
period and the amount that may be paid
under this Act in respect of gold produced
from the mine in the latter period, he may
direct that, for the purpose of this Act, such
portion of the gold produced from the mine
in the latter period shall be deemed to have
been produced in the first-mentioned period,
as would have been produced in that period,
addition to the gold actually produced
if the normal operation of the mine
had been carried on during that period.
(3) Where a corporation that operates a
gold mine or a mill, smelter or other like
establishment is a party to a contract with
another corporation, which contract affects
the cost of production of gold from a mine
operated by it or by such other corporation,
and the corporation controls such other
corporation or is controlled by it or both such
corporations are controlled by the same
persons, the Minister may, if it appears to
him to be necessary to give effect to the true
intent and purpose of this Act, fix, for the
purpose of this Act, the average cost of
production of gold produced from a mine
operated by either such corporation during
any period at such amount as he deems would
have been incurred by the corporation if the
said corporations were independent persons.
(4) For the purpose of subsection (3), a
person is deemed to control a corporation if
he owns, directly or indirectly, more than
fifty per cent of the shares of the corporation
that have full voting rights in all circum
stances. R.S., c. 95, s. 5.

**6.** The Minister may, as a condition to the
making of any payment to a person under
this Act, require that person
  * (_a_) to permit any person authorized by the
Minister in that behalf, at any reasonable
time, to enter upon and examine the mine
from which the gold in respect of which the
payment is to be made is produced, and all
works and premises in connection therewith
and to have access to and to examine all
books and records of that person relating to
the production of gold from the mine and
the costs of production thereof during any
period relevant for the purposes of this Act,
and
(6) to furnish to any person so authorized,
or to cause his employees to furnish or
make available to any person so authorized,
information relating to the production of
gold from the mine or the cost of production
of such gold for any period relevant for the
purposes of this Act. R.S., c. 95, s. 6.
  * (_a_) prescribing forms necessary for the
administration of this Act and the procedure
for the making of applications for payments
under this Act ;
(6) prescribing the amount, or the method
of calculating the amount, that may be
included in the cost of production of gold
from a mine for any period, in respect of
depreciation, amortization of pre-produc
tion expenses, and costs of exploration and
development in the mine, or that shall be
excluded from the cost of production of
gold from a mine for any period in respect
of the production of any other mineral or
product from the mine ;
  * (_c_) prescribing that, where the operation of
a mine is suspended during part of a
designated year for a reason specified in
the regulations beyond the control of the
operator, payments may be made under
this Act in respect of gold produced from
the mine during the remaining part of the
designated year in such amount as would
have been payable in respect of that gold
if the mine had been in normal operation
throughout the designated year, and the
method of computation of such amount ;
  * (_d_) prescribing that a work or undertaking
in which ore containing gold is mined but
which ore is sold by the operator thereof
before the gold is separated therefrom or
before the gold separated therefrom is
refined, shall be deemed to be a mine for
the purpose of this Act and the conditions
upon and the manner in which this Act
shall apply thereto ;
  * (_e_) prescribing in any case where gold is
produced from a mine in bullion, during
any period for which it is necessary to
compute the number of ounces of gold
produced from the mine for the purposes of
this Act, from concentrates produced from
the mine prior to that period, the time
when the gold shall be deemed to have
been produced and the manner in which
the cost of production thereof shall be
calculated, the conditions upon and the
manner in which this Act shall apply in
respect thereof, and defining the expression
"concentrates" for the purposes of this
paragraph, and the regulations made under
this paragraph shall operate retrospectively
to such date as may be fixed by regulation ;
  * (_f_) prescribing that, for the purpose of this
Act, a person is deemed not to be engaged
in operating a gold mine during a designated
year unless he produces during the desig
nated year more than a specified number
of ounces of gold, and prescribing circum
stances in which it may be determined that
no payment may be made under this Act
in respect of gold produced from a mine
where there is no reasonable possibility of
production of gold from the mine on a
commercial basis within a reasonable time ;
  * (_g_) adding to the list of communities in
Canada specified in the schedule the name
of any community in Canada that was an
existing community before the 1st day of
July 1965 ;
  * (_h_) prescribing the times at which amounts
payable under this Act may be paid, and
authorizing the Minister to make advances
in respect thereof and the conditions upon
which such advances may be made ;
  * (_i_) prescribing records to be kept and returns
to be made by persons making application
for payments under this Act or to whom
such payments have been made ; and
0) generally dealing with any matter
arising in the course of the administration
of this Act, for carrying into effect the
purposes of this Act and the true intent,
meaning and spirit of its provisions.
(2) Where pursuant to a regulation any
payment is made to any person by way of an
advance on account of payments that may be
made to that person under this Act, if that
person is subsequently found to be ineligible
to receive any payment, or to receive any
part of the payments made by way of such
advance, that person is liable to repay to Her
Majesty the amount of the advance, or the
amount of that part, as the case may be, and
any amount so repayable is recoverable as a
debt due to the Crown. R.S., c. 95, s. 7; 1963,
c. 25, s. 3.
