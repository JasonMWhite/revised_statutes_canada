CHAPTER 45 (IstSupp.)
An Act to amend the Territorial Sea and
Fishing Zones Act
[1969-70, c. 68}

**1.** Subsection 3(1) of the Territorial Sea
and Fishing Zones Act, chapter T-7 of the
Revised Statutes of Canada, 1970, is re
pealed and the following substituted there
for:
"3. (1) Subject to any exceptions
under section 5, the territorial sea of
Canada comprises those areas of the
sea having, as their inner limits, the
baselines described in section 5 and, as
their outer limits, lines measured sea
ward and equidistant from such base
lines so that each point of the outer
limit line of the territorial sea is distant
twelve nautical miles from the nearest
point of the baseline."

**2.** Subsection 4(1) of the said Act is
repealed and the following substituted
therefor:
"4. (1) The fishing zones of Canada
comprise such areas of the sea adjacent
to the coast of Canada as may be pre
scribed by the Governor in Council
pursuant to subsection 5.1(1)."

**3.** (1) Subsections 5(1) and (2) of the
"5. (1) The Governor in Council may,
by order, issue one or more lists of
geographical coordinates of points from
which baselines may be determined and
may, as he deems necessary, amend such
lists.
(2) In respect of any area for which
geographical coordinates of points have
been listed in a list issued pursuant to
subsection (1) and subject to any excep
tions in the list for the use of the low
water line along the coast between given
points and the use of the low water lines
of low tide elevations situated wholly or
partly at a distance not exceeding the
breadth of the territorial sea from the
coast, baselines are straight lines joining
the consecutive geographical coordinates
of points so listed."
(2) Subsections 5(4) and (5) of the said
Act are repealed and the following substi
tuted therefor:
"(4) Where, in his opinion, a portion
of the territorial sea of Canada deter-
mined in accordance with subsection 3(1)
would conflict with the territorial sea or
the fishing zones of a country other than
Canada or would be unreasonably close
to the coast of a country other than
Canada, the Governor in Council may,
by order, issue a list of geographical
coordinates of points from which, in
respect of the portion of the territorial
sea of Canada designated in the list, an
outer limit line may be determined in
substitution for the territorial sea outer
limit line described in subsection 3(1)
and such outer limit line shall thereupon
be substituted.
(5) For the purposes of this section,
low tide elevations are naturally formed
areas of land that are surrounded by and
above water at low tide but submerged
at high tide."

**4.** The said Act is further amended by
adding thereto, immediately after section 5
the following section:
"5.1 (1) Subject to subsection (2), the
Governor in Council may, by order,
prescribe as fishing zones of Canada such
areas of the sea adjacent to the coast
of Canada as are specified in the order
and may, as he deems necessary, amend
such areas.
(2) A copy of each order that the
Governor in Council proposes to make
under subsection (1) shall be published
in the Canada Gazette; and no order
may be made by the Governor in Coun
cil under subsection (1) based upon any
such proposal except after the expiration
of sixty days following publication of
the proposal in the Canada Gazette."
