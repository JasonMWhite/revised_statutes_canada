the citizens or subjects thereof or any other
persons inhabiting any of the countries,
territories or dominions of any enemy country
or that are otherwise condemnable as prize.

aforesaid, the Court shall exercise its prize
jurisdiction in respect of the like persons,
matters and things and in a like manner and
