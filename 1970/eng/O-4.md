Waste

**13.** (1) Subject to subsection 48(5), any

but without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, includes
  * (_a_) the inefficient or excessive use or
dissipation of reservoir energy ;
(6) the locating, spacing or drilling of a

**14.** (1) Where the Chief Conservation
Officer on reasonable and probable grounds

as defined in paragraph 13(2)0) or (g), is being
committed, the Chief Conservation Officer
may, subject to subsection (2) of this section,
order that all operations giving rise to such
waste cease until he is satisfied that the waste
has stopped.
(2) Before making any order under subsec
tion (1), the Chief Conservation Officer shall
hold an investigation at which interested
persons shall be given an opportunity to be
heard.
(3) Notwithstanding subsection (2), the
Chief Conservation Officer may, without an
investigation, make an order under this
section requiring all operations to be shut
down if in his opinion it is necessary to do so
to prevent damage to persons or property or
to prevent pollution ; but as soon as possible
after making any such order and in any event
within fifteen days thereafter, he shall hold
an investigation at which interested persons
shall be given an opportunity to be heard.
(4) At the conclusion of an investigation
under subsection (3) the Chief Conservation
Officer may set aside, vary or confirm the
order made, or make a new order. 1968-69, c.
48, s. 14.

(1) to ta ^ e over * ne management and control
of operations shall manage and control such
operations and do all things necessary to stop
the waste ; and the cost thereof shall be borne
by the person who holds the permit or the
lease and until paid constitutes a debt
recoverable by action in any court of
competent jurisdiction as a debt due to Her
Majesty in right of Canada. 1968-69, c. 48, s.

the Chief Conservation Officer after an
investigation under section 14 may appeal to

(2) After hearing the appeal the Committee
may
  * (_a_) set aside, confirm or vary the order
made by the Chief Conservation Officer;
(6) direct such works to be undertaken as
may be considered necessary to prevent
waste, the escape of oil or gas or any other
contravention of this Act or the regulations ;
or
  * (_c_) make such other or further order as the
Committee considers appropriate. 1968-69,
c. 48, s. 16.

**17.** (i) when the Chief Conservation Of
ficer on reasonable and probable grounds is
of the opinion that waste as defined in
paragraph 13(2)0) or (g) is occurring in the
&amp;lt; -i e 11
recovery of oil or gas trom a pool, he may
apply to the Committee for an order requiring
the operators within the pool to show cause
at a hearing to be held on a day specified in
the order why the Committee should not
make a direction in respect thereof.
(2) On the day specified in the order under
subsection (1), the Committee shall hold a
hearing at which the Chief Conservation
the operators and other interested
shall be given an opportunity to be
heard. 1968-69, c. 48, s. 17.

**18.** (1) If, after the hearing mentioned in
section 17, the Committee is of the opinion
that waste as defined in paragraph 13(2)(/) or
  * (_g_) is occurring in the recovery of oil or gas
from a pool, the Committee may, by order,
  * (_a_) direct the introduction of a scheme for
the collection, processing, disposition or
reinjection of any gas produced from such
pool ; or
(6) direct repressurizing, recycling or pres
sure maintenance for the pool or any part
of the pool and for, or incidental to such
purpose, direct the introduction or injection
into such pool, or part thereof, of gas, water
or other substance;
and the order may further direct that the
pool or part thereof specified in the order be
shut in if the requirements of the order are
not met or unless a scheme is approved by
the Committee and in operation by a date
fixed by the order.
(2) Notwithstanding subsection (1), the
Committee may permit the continued opera
tion of a pool or any part of a pool after the
date fixed by an order under subsection (1) if
in the opinion of the Committee a scheme for
the repressurizing, recycling or pressure
maintenance or the processing, storage or
disposal of gas is in course of preparation, but
any such continuation of operations is subject
to any conditions imposed by the Committee.
1968-69, c. 48, s. 18.

**19.** No scheme for repressurizing, recycling
or pressure maintenance in any field or pool,
or for the collection, processing and reinjection
of oil, gas or water in any field or pool shall

varied or suspended to the extent necessary
to give full effect to the terms of the unit
agreement.
(3) Where a unit agreement filed under this
provides that a unit operator shall be
the agent of the parties thereto with respect
