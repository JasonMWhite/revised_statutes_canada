or otherwise absents himself ;

creditor or creditors amount to one thousand
dollars, and
(6) the debtor has committed an act of
bankruptcy within six months next preced

(2) Where the petitioning creditor is a
secured creditor, he shall in his petition either
state that he is willing to give up his security
for the benefit of the creditors in the event of
a receiving order being made against the
debtor, or give an estimate of the value of his
security, and in the latter case he may be
admitted as a petitioning creditor, to the
extent of the balance of the debt due to him
after deducting the value so estimated, in the
same manner as if he were an unsecured
creditor.
(3) The petition shall be verified by
affidavit of the petitioner or by someone duly
authorized on his behalf having personal
knowledge of the facts alleged in the petition.

alleged in the petition, the court ma} , instead
of dismissing the petition, stay all proceedings

fit to impose on the petitioner as to costs or
on the debtor to prevent alienation of his
property and for such time as may be required
for trial of the issue relating to the disputed
facts.

reason make an order staying the proceedings
under a petition, either altogether or for a
limited time, on such terms and subject to
such conditions as the court may think just.

costs to the debtor, and proceedings under the
petition may be stayed until such security is

due diligence and effect, the court may, if by
reason of the delay or for any other cause it
is deemed just so to do, substitute or add as
petitioner any other creditor to whom the

other petition against a member of the same
partnership shall be filed in or transferred to
same court, and the court may give such
directions for consolidating the proceedings
under the petitions as it thinks just.

has been filed dies, the proceedings shall,
unless the court otherwise orders, be continued

payment of the proper funeral and testamen
tary expenses, until the petition is disposed
of, otherwise, in addition to any penalties to
which he may be subject, he is personally
liable therefor; but nothing in this section

property made or any act or thing done by
the legal personal representative in good faith
before the service of the petition. U.S., c. 14,
s. 22.

**27.** (1) When a receiving order is made,
the costs of the petitioner shall be taxed and
be payable out of the estate, unless the court
otherwise orders.

incurred by the trustee, the court may order
such costs to be paid by the petitioner. R.S.,
c. 14, s. 23.

necessary for the protection of the estate, at
any time after the filing of a petition and
before a receiving order is made, appoint a
licensed trustee as interim receiver of the
property of the debtor or of any part thereof
and direct him to take immediate possession
thereof upon such undertaking being given
by the petitioner as the court may impose as
to interference with the debtor s legal rights
and as to damages in the event of the petition
being dismissed.
(2) The interim receiver may, under the
direction of the court, take conservatory
measures and summarily dispose of property
that is perishable or likely to depreciate
rapidly in value and exercise such control
over the business of the debtor as the court
deems advisable, but the interim receiver shall

## PART IV

## PROPERTY OF THE BANKRUPT

**47.** The property of a bankrupt divisible
his creditors shall not comprise
  * (_a_) property held by the bankrupt in trust
for any other person,
(6) any property that as against the bank
rupt is exempt from execution or seizure
under the laws of the province within which
the property is situated and within which
the bankrupt resides,
but it shall comprise
  * (_c_) all property wherever situated of the
bankrupt at the date of his bankruptcy or
that may be acquired by or devolve on him
before his discharge, and

part of the salary, wages or other remuneration
as the court may determine having regard to
the family responsibilities and personal situa
tion of the bankrupt.
(2) An order under subsection (1) shall be
directed to the bankrupt and his employer

served on the bankrupt and is binding on
him, and when the order is served on his
employer it is binding on the employer named
therein and any subsequent employer of the
bankrupt if a copy of the order is served on
such subsequent employer ; but nothing in
this section shall be construed to require the
trustee to serve such an order on any employer
of a bankrupt if it appears to the trustee
inexpedient to do so.
(5) A bankrupt served with an order or a
copy thereof under subsection (1) who, without
reasonable justification, fails or neglects to
comply with the terms thereof is guilty of an
offence and liable to the punishment pre

that has or a copy of which has been served
on an employer is not complied with in
accordance with its terms, the court may, on
the application of the trustee, order the
employer in default to pay to the trustee the
amount of money that the estate would have
received had the employer complied with the
terms of the order made under subsection (1).
(7) For the purposes of this section, the

provided for the benefit of the employee and
is not of any substantial benefit to the

or other proceedings for the recovery of a
claim provable in bankruptcy until the trustee
has been discharged or until the proposal has
been refused, unless with the leave of the
court and on such terms as the court may
impose.
(2) Subject to section 57 and sections 98 to
105, a secured creditor may realize or otherwise
deal with his security in the same manner as
he would have been entitled to realize or deal
with it if this section had not been passed,
unless the court otherwise orders, but in so
ordering the court shall not postpone the
right of the secured creditor to realize or
otherwise deal with his security, except as
follows :
  * (_a_) in the case of a security for a debt due
at the date of the bankruptcy or of the
approval of the proposal or which becomes
due not later than six months thereafter
such right shall not be postponed for more
than six months from such date; and
  * (_b_) in the case of a security for a debt that
does not become due until more than six
months after the date of the bankruptcy or
of the approval of the proposal such right
shall not be postponed for more than six
months from such date, unless all instal
ments of interest that are more than six
months in arrears are paid and all other
defaults of more than six months standing
are cured, and then only so long as no
instalment of interest remains in arrears or
defaults remain uncured for more than six
months, but, in any event, not beyond the

the said property is situated as fully and
effectually and to all intents and purposes as
if no receiving order or assignment had been
made under this Act, unless the receiving
order or assignment, or notice thereof, or
caution, has been registered against the
property in the proper office prior to the
registration of the deed, conveyance, transfer,
agreement for sale, mortgage, charge or
hypothec in accordance with the laws of the

bankrupt, revert and be delivered to the
author on payment of the expenses so
incurred and the product of such expenses
shall also be delivered to the author or his
heirs and any contract or agreement between

equitable estate of the bankrupt therein. R.S.,
c. 14, s. 53.

becomes bankrupt, the court may authorize
the trustee to commence and prosecute any
action in the names of the trustee and of the

redemption or purchase for cancellation of its
shares rendered the corporation insolvent.

and the interest thereon, as was received by
the shareholder and not repaid to the
corporation.

shall not be entered against or be binding on
a director who had, in accordance with any
applicable law governing the operation of the

of the dividend or the redemption or purchase
for cancellation of the shares of the capital
stock of the corporation and had thereby
exonerated himself under such law from any
liability therefor.
(4) Nothing in this section shall be construed
to affect any right, under any applicable law
governing the operation of the corporation,
of the directors to recover from a shareholder
the whole or any part of any dividend, or any
redemption or purchase price, made or paid
to the shareholder when the corporation was
insolvent or that rendered the corporation
insolvent.

interest claimed. R.S., c. 14, s. 83.

**96.** Where a bankrupt was, at the date of

contracts as a member of two or more distinct
firms, or as a sole contractor and also as
member of a firm, the circumstance that the

same individuals, or that the sole contractor
is also one of the joint contractors, shall not
prevent proof, in respect of the contracts,
against the properties respectively liable on
the contracts. R.S., c. 14, s. 84.

and others employed by the bankrupt may be
made in one proof by the bankrupt or someone
on his behalf by attaching thereto a schedule
setting forth the names and addresses of the
workmen and others and the amounts severally

any workman or other wage-earner to file a
separate proof on his own behalf. R.S., c. 14,
s. 85.
Proof by Secured Creditors

**98.** (1) Where a secured creditor realizes
his security, he may prove for the balance

redeeming the security or requiring it to be
realized, and if the trustee does not, within
one month after receiving the notice or such
further time or times as the court may allow,
signify in writing to the creditor his election
to exercise the power, he is not entitled to
exercise it ; and the equity of redemption or
any other interest in the property comprised
in the security that is vested in the trustee
shall vest in the creditor, and the amount of
his claim shall be reduced by the amount at
which the security has been valued. R.S., c.

an amended valuation made by the creditor.
R.S., c. 14, s. 90.

**103.** (1) Where the trustee has not elected
to acquire the security as provided in this
Act, a creditor may at any time amend the

satisfaction of the trustee or the court that
the valuation and proof were made bona fide
on a mistaken estimate or that the security
has diminished or increased in value since its
previous valuation.

about to conceal or destroy any of his
property or any books, documents or
