and powers of insurance companies incor
porated by the Parliament of Canada, and
by the Legislature of the former Province of
Canada, and to prescribe the limitations to
be placed on the exercise of such powers ; and
WHEREAS it is desirable to provide for the
registration of such companies and of British
insurance companies which may desire to
carry on the business of insurance in Canada,
and for the voluntary registration of provincial
companies ; and
WHEREAS the said companies incorporated
by the Parliament of Canada and by the
Legislature of the former Province of Canada
carry on business in more than one province
of Canada and many of them carry on
business in Great Britain, and in other
Commonwealth and foreign countries; and
WHEREAS the said British insurance com
panies, when permitted to carry on business
in Canada, carry on business in more than
one province ; and
WHEREAS the insurance business transacted
within and outside Canada by companies
incorporated by the Parliament of Canada,
and by the Legislature of the former Province
of Canada, and within Canada by British
insurance companies, constitutes an important
factor in the international and interprovincial
trade and commercial relations of Canada ;
and
WHEREAS it is contrary to the public interest
insurance companies that are unable to
their liabilities to policyholders in
Canada as they become due, or are otherwise
insolvent, should be permitted to carry on the
business of insurance in Canada ; and
WHEREAS it is desirable to provide by a
system of returns and inspection against such
companies engaging in or continuing to carry
on business in Canada while unable to
discharge their liabilities to such policyholders
as they become due or while otherwise
insolvent, and to declare the conditions upon
which such companies shall be deemed to be
insolvent and be subject to be wound up
under the provisions of the Winding-up Act.

authorized by a by-law made by the directors
and confirmed at a general meeting of the

the provisions of Part III and on complying
with such terms and conditions as may be
fixed and prescribed by the Treasury Board,
upon the report of the Superintendent,
transact such class or classes of insurance as
may be specified in the certificate of registry
to be from time to time granted to the
company pursuant to the provisions hereafter
in this Act contained, but the company shall
maintain such separate and distinct accounts,
funds and securities as required by section 81.
(2) The amount of the said separate and
distinct fund to be maintained in respect of
any class or classes of insurance business other
than life insurance shall be fixed by the
Treasury Board and shall depend on the
number and nature of the additional class or
of business so authorized but shall in
case be less than fifty thousand dollars.
(3) In the case of a company registered to
transact the business of life insurance, the
company may, for the purposes of creating or
maintaining a separate and distinct fund in
respect of any class of insurance business
other than life insurance,
  * (_a_) if duly authorized by by-law, make
transfers from the shareholders fund but
the maximum amount that may be so
transferred at any particular time is an
amount equal to the surplus in the
shareholders fund at that time ; and
(6) if duly authorized by by-law passed by
the directors and approved by at least a
two-thirds vote of the members present or
represented at a special general meeting of
the company duly called for that purpose,
make transfers from the life insurance funds
but
  * (_i_) if the surplus in all of the life insurance
funds combined is less than one million
dollars, the maximum amount that may
be so transferred from any life insurance
fund at a particular time is the amount
by which twenty-five per cent of the
surplus in that fund exceeds the aggregate
of all transfers from that fund prior to
that time to all such separate and distinct
funds, and the aggregate of all such
transfers from the life insurance funds,
whenever made, shall not exceed one
hundred thousand dollars, and
  * (_ii_) if the surplus in all of the life
insurance funds combined is one million
dollars or more, the maximum amount
that may be so transferred from any life
insurance fund at a particular time is the
amount by which ten per cent of the
surplus in that fund exceeds the aggregate
of all transfers from that fund prior to
that time to all such separate and distinct
funds.

(3)(6) the surplus in any fund is required to
be determined, the surplus shall be taken as

deposited in the Department as required by
this Act.

a particular life insurance fund pursuant to
subsection (3), then in any distribution of the
profits of the separate and distinct fund to
which the transfer was made, a portion of the
profits remaining after deducting any amount
set aside by the directors for distribution as
dividends to holders of participating policies,
if any, equal to the proportion thereof that
the total amount transferred from that life
insurance fund to the separate and distinct
fund is of the total amount transferred from
all funds of the company to the separate and
distinct fund shall be credited to that life
insurance fund.
(6) In the case of a company other than a
company registered to transact only the
business of life insurance, the company may,
for the purpose of creating the said separate
and distinct fund, by by-law transfer as such
fund the whole or any portion of the surplus
of the company which under this Act is
available for the payment of dividends to its
shareholders, and the amount of such separate
and distinct fund shall not be less than one
hundred thousand dollars.
(7) Any separate and distinct fund referred
to in this section may in the case of any
company be liquidated and wound up
independently of the other business of the
company, and the Winding-up Act applies to
such funds as fully as if the company
transacted only the class or classes of business
in respect of which such funds are maintained.
  * (_g_) i n the winding-up of the company or of
any fund thereof, the capital stock, if any,
subscribed before the date of the separation
of the funds herein referred to, is liable, both
as to the amount paid and the amount unpaid
thereon, only for claims or losses arising from
the class or classes of business transacted prior
to the said date. R.S., c. 31, s. 46; 1960-61, c.
13, s. 11.

subscription contract, and shall not form
a charge upon or be paid out of the paid-up
capital nor from the insurance funds, nor be
in any way chargeable directly or indirectly
against the policyholders.
(2) At the time application is made for a
certificate of registry under this Act by a
company there shall be submitted to the
Minister a sworn statement setting forth the
several sums of money paid in connection
with the incorporation and organization of
the company, and such statement shall, in
addition, include a list of all the unpaid
liabilities, if any, in connection with or arising
out of such incorporation and organization.
(3) Until the certificate of registry is
granted, no payments on account of incorpo
ration and organization expenses shall be
made out of the moneys paid in by
shareholders, except reasonable sums for the
payment of clerical assistance, legal services,
office rental, advertising, stationery, postage
and expenses of travel, if any.
(4) The Minister shall not grant the certifi
cate of registry until he is satisfied that all
the requirements of this Act and of the special
Act incorporating the company, as to the
subscriptions to the capital stock, the payment
of money by shareholders on account of their
subscriptions, the election of directors and
other preliminaries have been complied with,
and unless he is satisfied that the expenses of
incorporation and organization, including the
commission payable for the sale of the
company s stock, are reasonable. R.S., c. 31,
ss. 47, 48.

**50.** (1) Where the company does not obtain
a certificate of registry before the expiry of
its Act of incorporation, and stock books have
been opened and subscriptions in whole or in
part paid, no part of the money so paid,
whether on account of capital or of premium
on capital or accrued interest thereon, shall
be disbursed for commissions, salaries, charges
for services or for other purposes, except a
reasonable amount for payment of clerical
assistance, legal services, office rental, adver
tising, stationery, postage and expenses of
travel, if any, unless it is so provided by
resolution of the subscribers at a meeting
convened after notice, at which the greater
part of the money so paid is represented by
subscribers or by proxies of subscribers; and
each subscriber is entitled at such meeting to
one vote for each ten dollars paid, either as
capital or as premium on capital, on account
of his subscription.
(2) Where the amount allowed by such
resolution for commission, salaries or charges
for services is deemed insufficient by the
provisional directors or directors, as the case
may be, or if no resolution for such purpose
be passed after a meeting has been duly
called, then the provisional directors or
directors may apply to a judge of any superior
or county court having jurisdiction where the
head office of the company is situated, to
settle and determine all charges and the
reasonableness of the amount of the disburse
ments already made, to which such money
and interest, if any, shall be subject, before
distribution of the balance to the subscribers.
(3) Notice of the meeting and notice of the
application respectively referred to in subsec
tions (1) and (2) shall be given by mailing the
notice in the post office, registered and post
paid, at least twenty-one days prior to the
date fixed for such meeting or the hearing of
such application, to the several subscribers at
their respective post office addresses as shown
by the stock books; and each of such notices
shall contain a statement, in summary form,
of the several amounts for commissions,
salaries, charges for services and disbursements
which it is proposed shall be provided by
resolution for payment, or settled and deter
mined by a judge, as the case may be.
(4) Votes of subscribers may be given at
such meeting by proxy, but the holder of such
proxy must be himself a subscriber, and
subscribers may be heard either in person or
counsel on such application.
(5) In order that the sums paid and payable
under this section may be equitably borne by
the subscribers, the provisional directors or
the directors, as the case may be, shall, after
the amount of such sums is ascertained as
herein provided, fix the proportionate part
thereof chargeable to each subscriber in the
ratio of the number of shares in respect of
which he is a subscriber to the total number
of shares bona fide subscribed.
(6) The respective amounts so fixed shall,
before return to the subscribers of the sums
paid in by them, be deducted therefrom, and
if the respective sums paid in are less than
the amounts so fixed, then the deficiency in
each case shall be payable forthwith by the
subscriber to the provisional directors or the
directors, as the case may be.
(7) The total of the amounts of deficiency
mentioned in subsection (6) that the provi
sional directors or the directors are unable to
get in or collect in what seems to them a
reasonable time, shall, with any legal cost
incurred, be deducted by them from the sums
then remaining in their hands to the credit of
the several subscribers in the ratio hereinbefore
mentioned, the shares in respect of which no
such collections have been made being
eliminated from the basis of calculation.
(8) The provisional directors or the direc
tors, after payment by them of the sums
payable under this section, shall return to the
subscribers, with any interest accretions, the
respective balances of the moneys paid in by
the subscribers. R.S., c. 31, s. 49.

its account with the Minister naming in
detail the several securities, their par value,
their date of maturity, and value at which
they are received as deposit ; and such book
shall be open to public inspection;
(6) in each case, before the granting of any
certificate of registry, or the renewal of any
such certificate, make a report to the
Minister that the requirements of this Act
have been complied with, and that from
the statement of the affairs of the company
it is in a condition to meet its liabilities ;
  * (_c_) keep a record of the certificates of
registry as they are granted ;
  * (_d_) visit personally, or cause a duly qualified
member of his staff to visit, the head office
of each company in Canada, at least once
in every year, and examine the statements
of the condition and affairs of each
company, and report thereon to the Minister
as to all matters requiring his attention and
decision; but where in the opinion of the
Superintendent the circumstances so war
rant in the case of any company, he may
make such examination less frequently than
annually but not less frequently than once
in every three years ; and
  * (_e_) prepare for the Minister, from the said
statements, an annual report, giving full
particulars of the condition and affairs of
each company. R.S., c. 31, s. 72.

**73.** (1) Where the Superintendent, after an
examination into the condition and affairs of
any company registered to transact business
in Canada, as disclosed by the annual or
other statements furnished by the company
to the Minister or for any other reason, deems
it necessary or expedient to make a further
examination into the affairs of the company
and so reports to the Minister, the Minister
may, in his discretion, instruct the Superin
tendent to visit the head office of the
company, thoroughly to inspect and examine
into all its affairs and to make all such further
inquiries as are necessary to ascertain its
condition and ability to meet its obligations,
and whether it has complied with this Act.
(2) The officers or agents of such company
cause the books of the company to be
for the inspection of the Superintendent,
and shall otherwise facilitate such examina-
tion so far as it is in their power.
(3) For the purpose of such inquiry, the
Superintendent may examine under oath the
officers or agents of the company. R.S., c 31
s. 73.

**74.** (1) A report of all companies so visited
by the Superintendent shall be entered in a
book kept for that purpose, with notes and
memoranda showing the condition of each
company.

other matters that he thinks desirable to be
made known to the Minister. R.S., c. 31, s. 74.

**75.** (1) Where, upon an examination of the
assets of any company, it appears to the
Superintendent that the value placed by the
company upon the real estate owned by it or
any parcel thereof is too great, he may either
request the company to procure an appraisal
of such real estate by one or more competent
valuators, or may himself procure an appraisal
at the company s expense, and the appraised
value, if it is materially less than that shown
in the return made by the company, may be
substituted for the latter in the annual report
prepared for the Minister by the Superintend
ent.
(2) Where it appears to the Superintendent
that the amount of any loan secured by
mortgage or hypothec upon any parcel of real
estate, together with the interest due and
accrued thereon, is greater than the value of
the parcel, or that the parcel is not sufficient
security for the loan and interest, he may in
like manner request the company to procure
an appraisal thereof, or may himself at the
company s expense procure an appraisal, and
if from the appraised value it appears that
the parcel of real estate is not adequate
security for the loan and interest, he may
write off from the loan and interest a sum
sufficient to reduce the same to such an
amount as may fairly be realizable from such
real estate, in no case to exceed the appraised
value thereof, and may insert the reduced
amount in his annual report.
(3) Where it appears to the Superintendent
that a complete and thorough audit of the
books of the company should be made or a
company makes a written request for such
audit, the Superintendent may nominate a
competent accountant who shall, under the
direction of the Superintendent, make a
special audit of the company s books, accounts
and securities and report thereon to the
Superintendent in writing verified by the
oath of such accountant.
(4) The expenses of such special audit shall
be borne by the company and the auditor s
account therefor when approved in writing by
the Superintendent shall be payable by the
company forthwith. R.S., c. 31, s. 75.

**76.** (1) The Superintendent may address
any inquiries to any company registered
under this Act, or to the president, manager,
actuary or secretary thereof, for the purpose
of ascertaining its condition and ability to
meet its obligations, and it shall be the duty
of any company so addressed promptly to
reply in writing to any such inquiries.
(2) The Superintendent may, in his discre
tion, embody in his annual report to the
Minister the inquiries made by him under
this section and the answers thereto. R.S., c.
31,8.76.

**77.** (1) In the annual report prepared for
the Minister, the Superintendent shall allow
as assets only such of the investments of the
several companies as are authorized by this
Act, or as were authorized by law at the time
of their acquisition.
(2) In the report the Superintendent shall
make all necessary corrections in the annual
statements made by the companies as herein
provided and may increase or diminish the
liabilities of such companies to the true and
correct amounts as ascertained by him in the
examination of their affairs at the head office
thereof in Canada, or otherwise. R.S., c. 31,
s. 77.

**78.** (1) An appeal lies in a summary
manner from the ruling of the Superintendent
as to the admissibility of any asset not
allowed by him, or as to any item or amount
added to liabilities, or as to any correction
and that court has the power to make all
necessary rules for the conduct of appeals
under this section.
(2) For the purposes of any appeal, the
Superintendent shall at the request of the
company concerned give a certificate in
writing setting forth the ruling appealed from
and the reasons therefor, and the ruling is
binding upon the company unless the compa
ny within fifteen days after notice of the
ruling serves upon the Superintendent notice
of its intention to appeal therefrom, setting
forth the grounds of appeal, and within
fifteen days thereafter files its appeal with
the registrar of the court and with due
diligence prosecutes the appeal, in which case
action on such ruling shall be suspended until
the court has rendered judgment thereon.

assets of the fund, the percentage limits
specified in subsections 63(7) and (8) do not
apply to the investments and loans constitut
ing the assets of the fund and in the
application of those limits to the company as

**82.** (1) The liabilities in the annual state
ment, required to be filed under this Act, of
every company shall include a reserve for all
unmatured obligations guaranteed under the
terms of its policies dependent on life,
disability, sickness, accident, or on any other
contingency, or on a term certain, and shall
also include a reserve for profits ascertained
and apportioned for future distribution.
(2) In computing the reserve for all
unmatured obligations guaranteed under the
terms of the policies dependent on life
contingencies only, the valuation shall be
the rate of interest assumed shall not
the rate prescribed in Schedule III
such higher rate as may be authorized
by the Superintendent for a particular class
of policies issued by any company, on
application to the Superintendent by the
company accompanied by evidence satis
factory to the Superintendent that the
higher rate is appropriate for that class of
policies; and the Superintendent may at
any time withdraw such authorization;
(6) the tables of mortality used shall be the
tables prescribed in Schedule III, subject to
any modification in the age that the
company may deem appropriate and neces
sary to secure the proper valuation of a
particular class of policies and that has the
effect of increasing the reserves, but if it
appears to a company that the reserves for
a particular class of policies cannot be
appropriately computed by any table of
mortality prescribed in that Schedule or by
any such table modified as aforesaid, the
company shall apply to the Superintendent
for approval of the table the company
deems most appropriate for the computa
tion;
  * (_c_) the method of valuation shall be that
specified in Schedule III or any adaptation
thereof approved by the Superintendent, or
any other method the company deems
appropriate ; but the method used shall be
such that the reserve calculated in accord
ance therewith shall not be less at any
duration than the reserve computed in
accordance with the valuation provisions in
that Schedule, and the method used shall
make adequate provision for the guaranteed
values at the subsequent durations of the
policy according to the rate of interest and
the table of mortality used in the valuation ;
and
  * (_d_) the reserve in the first policy year need
not in any event exceed the reserve
computed in accordance with the rate of
interest and table of mortality used in the
valuation and the method of valuation
described in Schedule III.
(3) In the reserve for all
on contingencies other than life contingencies
only, the bases and methods of valuation
employed by the company shall be such as to
place an adequate value on the liabilities
thereunder, and shall be such that the value
of the benefits under each and every policy
shall in no case be less than the value placed
upon the future premiums.
(4) There shall be included in the annual
statement a certificate by the actuary of the
company, or by the actuary responsible for
the valuation if the company has no actuary,
to the effect that the reserves shown in the
valuation summary are not less than the
reserves required by the provisions of this
section, and in addition that in his opinion
the reserves make a good and sufficient
provision for all unmatured obligations of the
company guaranteed under the terms of its
policies.
(5) Where it appears to the Superintendent
that the reserve included in the liabilities in
the annual statement of any company has
not been computed in accordance with the
provisions of subsections (1) to (4), he shall
make known to the company in what respects
in his opinion the valuation does not comply
with those provisions with a view to having
such alterations made in the valuation as
may be necessary to secure compliance with
those provisions, and on failure of the
company to have such alterations made the
company shall furnish to the Superintendent,
on request, the full particulars of its policies
necessary for computation of the reserve
required in accordance with the provisions of
those subsections, and the reserve so computed
by the Superintendent shall be substituted in
the liabilities in the annual statement for the
reserve computed by the company.
(6) Once in every five years or oftener at
the discretion of the Minister, the Superin
tendent shall himself value or cause to be
valued under his supervision all the policies
of every company, and any such valuation
shall be made on the bases and in accordance
with the methods the company purports to
use in computing the reserve included in the
liabilities in the annual statement of the
company made as of the valuation date, or if
the valuation is made as of a date other than
annual statement date, then in the annual
of the company last made preceding
date of valuation, subject to such
as may be made in the reserve
subsection (5).
(7) Instead of making a valuation as
provided under subsection (6), the Superin
tendent may satisfy himself by an examina
tion of the valuation made by the company
whether the company is maintaining the
reserve it purports to maintain and whether
the reserve maintained complies with this Act.
(8) In any case where the Superintendent
approves of a table of mortality under the
provisions of this section he shall include in
his annual report to the Minister such
information concerning the origin and charac
teristics of the table and the circumstances in
which it may be used as the Superintendent
deems necessary and appropriate ; and approv
al of any such table may in like manner be
withdrawn by the Superintendent.
(9) In computing the reserve to be included
in the annual statement for profits ascertained
and apportioned for future distribution in
respect of policies providing for distribution
of surplus or profits at intervals less frequent
than quinquennial, and known as deferred
dividend policies, the profits or surplus to
which each class of such policyholders may
be equitably entitled shall be ascertained and
apportioned at least once in every five years,
reckoning from the date of the policies, and
the total sum of the shares so ascertained and
apportioned shall be a liability of the
company and shall be so shown in its accounts
until actually distributed and paid to the
policyholders entitled thereto ; but in respect
of deferred dividend policies issued before
January 1, 1911, the amount of profits or
surplus so ascertained and apportioned may
be shown in the accounts as a contingent
apportionment and not as a liability. R.S., c.
31, s. 82; 1960-61, c. 13, s. 17; 1964-65, c. 40,
s. 10.

**83.** Every company, notwithstanding any
thing to the contrary in any special Act or
elsewhere, shall keep separate and distinct
accounts of participating and non-participat-
ing business. R.S., c. 31, s. 83.

**84.** (1) The directors of a company that
has a capital stock may, from time to time,
set apart such portion of the net profits as
they deem safe and proper for distribution as
dividends or bonuses to shareholders and
holders of participating policies, ascertaining
the part thereof that has been derived from
participating policies and distinguishing such
part from the profits derived from other
sources.
(2) Notwithstanding anything to the con
trary in any special Act or elsewhere, the
holders of participating policies are entitled
to share in that portion of the profits set
apart that has been distinguished as having
been derived from participating policies
(including a share of the profits arising from
the sale of securities in the proportion of the
mean participating fund to the mean total
funds) to the extent of,
  * (_a_) at least ninety per cent thereof in any
year in which the mean participating fund
does not exceed two hundred and fifty
million dollars;
(6) at least ninety-two and one-half per
cent thereof in any year in which the mean
participating fund exceeds two hundred
and fifty million dollars but does not exceed
five hundred million dollars;
  * (_c_) at least ninety-five per cent thereof in
any year in which the mean participating
fund exceeds five hundred million dollars
but does not exceed one thousand million
dollars; and
  * (_d_) at least ninety-seven and one-half per
cent thereof in any year in which the mean
participating fund exceeds one thousand
million dollars.
(3) Before fixing or arriving at the amount
of divisible profits, interest on the amount of
the unimpaired paid-up capital stock, but not
including any premiums or bonuses paid
thereon or in respect thereof that have been
expended in the establishment, prosecution
or extension of the company s business or
applied to making good any impairment of
and on any other sum or sums from
time to time standing at the credit of the
may be allowed or credited to
shareholders at the average net rate of
earned in the preceding year or other
under consideration upon the mean
total funds of the company ; such shareholders,
however, are to be charged with a fair
proportion of all losses incurred upon invest
ments or other losses of a similar character in
the proportion of the mean shareholders fund
to the mean total funds.
(4) This section does not interfere with the
right of the participating policyholders of
any such company to share in the profits
realized from the non-participating branch of
its business in any case in which such
policyholders are so entitled under the Acts
relating to such company in force on the 4th
day of May 1910. R.S., c. 31, s. 84.

**85.** (1) Every company shall at all times
retain in Canada and under its own control
assets of a value at least equal to the amount
of its total liabilities to its policyholders in
Canada and of such assets an amount at least
equal to two-thirds of its said total liabilities
in Canada shall consist of investments in or
loans upon Canadian securities, but if it is
necessary to remove from Canada any portion
of the securities held in Canada for the
purpose of exchanging the same for other
securities authorized under this Act, or for
any similar purpose, they may be entrusted
for the purpose intended to a responsible
bank, trust corporation or other corporation
carrying on business outside Canada.
(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in
its Act of incorporation or in any Act
amending such Act, a company may deposit
in any country outside Canada such portion
of its funds and securities as may be necessary
or desirable in respect of the business of the
company in that country, but the amount so
deposited shall not exceed
  * (_a_) the reserves on the company s policies
in that country together with a proportion
of the combined paid capital, contingency
reserves and unappropriated surplus of the
country are of the reserves on all of its
policies, or
(6) the amount required to be so deposited
by the laws of that country,
is the greater.
(3) Funds and securities for the protection
of, or for the purpose of paying claims under
policies issued in one country outside Canada
and payable in the currency of another such
country, may be deposited in the country in
the currency of which the policies are payable,
and the securities so deposited shall not be
deemed to be funds and securities deposited
in such country within the meaning of
subsection (2); and funds and securities held
in Canada in trust for policyholders outside
Canada in pursuance of a reinsurance agree
ment between such company and any other
company shall not be deemed to be funds and
securities retained in Canada.
(4) Except as provided in this section all
the securities of every company shall be held
at the head office of the company or elsewhere
in Canada. R.S., c. 31, s. 85.

**86.** Except for the bona fide purposes of
protecting investments previously made by it
or of making investments authorized by
section 64 or 65, no such company shall, nor
shall its directors or officers or any of them
on its behalf, under colour of an investment
of the company s funds or otherwise, directly
or indirectly be employed, concerned or
interested in the formation or promotion of
any other corporation, but nothing in this Act
shall be deemed to prohibit any company
from investing funds in securities of a newly
formed corporation under and subject to the
provisions of section 63. 1964-65, c. 40, s. 11.

**87.** No such company shall subscribe to or
participate in or employ the funds of the
company in any underwriting for the purchase
or sale of securities or property of any kind,
nor shall any director or officer, except for
the bona fide purpose of protecting investments
already made by the company, enter into any
transaction for such purchase or sale on
permitted by this as a bona fide
permanent investment on behalf of any such
company. R.S., c. 31, s. 87.

**88.** (1) No salary, compensation or emolu
ment shall be paid to any director of any
company for his services as director unless
authorized by a vote of the members in the
case of a mutual company, and by a vote of
the shareholders and other members, if any,
in the case of a company having capital stock.
(2) No salary, compensation or emolument
shall be paid to any officer or trustee of any
company unless authorized by a vote of the
directors, nor shall any salary, compensation
or emolument amounting in any year to more
than ten thousand dollars be paid to any
agent or employee unless the contract under
which such amount becomes payable has been
approved by the board of directors. R.S., c.
31,s.88; 1960-61, c. 13, s. 18.

**89.** The company shall have power by by
law of the directors to provide for the creation
of a staff pension and insurance fund, but
such by-law shall before becoming effective
be submitted to and be approved at an annual
meeting of the company or at a special
general meeting of the members thereof,
notice of the intention to consider such by
law having been in either case duly given.
R.S.,c. 31,s.89.

**90.** (1) Every company registered under
Part III to transact the business of life
insurance, whether alone or in combination
with any other class of insurance business, has
power, with the permission of the Minister, to
make an agreement
  * (_a_) to amalgamate its property and business
with the property and business of any other
such company that is registered to transact
the classes of business to be so amalgamated ;
(6) to transfer all or any portion of its
policies or of its property and business to,
or to reinsure all or any portion of its
policies in, any company that has the power
to make such an agreement and holds a
certificate of registry from the Minister,
under this or any other Act, to transact the
classes of insurance business to be so
transferred or reinsured; or to transfer all
or any portion of its policies, other than its
policies in Canada, to or to reinsure the
same in any company not so registered that
has the power to make such an agreement ;
or
  * (_c_) to purchase and take over all or any
portion of the business and property, or to
reinsure all or any portion of the policies,
of any company whether so registered or
not that transacts the business of life
insurance within Canada or elsewhere,
whether alone or in combination with other
classes of insurance business, being classes
of insurance business that the purchasing
or reinsuring company is registered to
transact ;
and to enter into all contracts and undertak
ings necessary thereunto, but no such agree
ment is effective until it is sanctioned by the
Treasury Board.
(2) Without limiting the powers a company
has under subsection (1), any company to
which that subsection applies may, for the
purpose of acquiring the business and property
of a company pursuant to that subsection,
purchase not less than sixty-seven per cent of
the outstanding shares of any other insurance
company incorporated under the laws of
Canada or of any province thereof subject to
the following provisions :
  * (_a_) no such purchase shall be made unless
authorized by the Treasury Board ;
(6) the Treasury Board may authorize such
purchase on the report of the Superintend
ent, supported by evidence that
  * (_i_) an offer to purchase has been made to
all the shareholders of the other insurance
company and has been accepted by the
holders of at least sixty-seven per cent of
the outstanding shares thereof, such
evidence of acceptance being in the form
of written agreements or in the form of a
resolution signed by or on behalf of the
shareholders voting therefor, in person or
by proxy, at a meeting of the shareholders
duly called to consider the offer, or being
partly in one form and partly in the
other, and
  * (_ii_) the purchase has been approved by
at least three-fourths of the votes cast by
shareholders and three-fourths of the
votes cast by policyholders at a special
general meeting of the company duly
called to consider the purchase ;
  * (_c_) the power to purchase shares under this
subsection is in addition to the powers set
forth in sections 63 and 65 and the
limitations, conditions and exceptions con
tained in those sections do not apply to
any such purchase of shares ; and
  * (_d_) where a company has purchased shares
under this subsection, the company shall,
under the provisions of subsection (1),
acquire the business, rights and property,
and assume the duties, obligations and
liabilities, of the other insurance company
within the period of two years after the
purchase has been authorized by the
Treasury Board, but on being satisfied that
the circumstances so warrant, the Treasury
Board may extend that period from time
to time; and after the expiration of that
period and of any extension thereof, the
said shares shall not be allowed as assets of
the purchasing company in the annual
report prepared by the Superintendent for
the Minister and the Superintendent may
direct the company to sell or otherwise
absolutely dispose of the shares.
(3) When any such agreement has been
entered into, the directors of the companies
that are parties thereto may, on compliance
with this section, apply to the Treasury Board
to sanction the agreement, and the Board,
after hearing the directors and other persons
whom it considers entitled to be heard upon
the application or giving them an opportunity
be heard, may sanction the agreement if
Board is satisfied that no sufficient
to the agreement has been estab
(4) Before any such application is made to
the Treasury Board,
  * (_a_) notice of intention to make the applica
tion shall be published in the Canada
Gazette, stating the day on or after which
the application will be made, such day
being at least thirty days after the date of
publication of the notice;
(6) a copy of the notice together with
  * (_i_) a statement of the nature and terms
of the agreement,
  * (_ii_) an abstract of the material facts
embodied in the agreement, and
  * (_iii_) copies of the actuarial and other
reports upon which the agreement is
founded, including a report by an
independent actuary,
shall be served on the shareholders, mem
bers and policyholders in Canada of the
companies concerned, by transmission
through the post office to the registered or
other known address of each shareholder,
member and policyholder, and within such
period that they may be delivered in due
course of delivery at least thirty days before
the day stated in the notice on or after
which the application will be made ; but
the Minister may dispense with such service
to the extent that, in his view, the
circumstances of the case so warrant ; and
  * (_c_) the agreement shall be open to the
inspection of the shareholders, members
and policyholders at the principal offices
of the companies for a period of at least
thirty days after service of the notice and
documents provided for in paragraph (6),
or after the Minister may have dispensed
with such service; and any shareholder,
member, or policyholder is entitled to a
copy of the agreement on request therefor
in writing to the principal office of the
company of which he is a shareholder,
member or policyholder, as the case may
be.
(5) I n an y case where in the opinion of the
Minister the interests of a group of policy-
holders affected by an agreement entered into
pursuant to subsection (1) may be prejudiced
by delay in the agreement becoming effective,
he may shorten the period of thirty days
referred to in paragraphs (4)(6) and
  * (_c_) to the extent that, in his view, the
circumstances of the case warrant.
(6) Whenever the Treasury Board sanctions
an agreement under this section, the compa
nies concerned or the combined or continuing
company, as the case may be, shall, within
ten days after the date of sanction, deposit
with the Superintendent,
  * (_a_) certified copies of the statement of the
assets and liabilities of each company
concerned,
(6) a statement of the nature and terms of
the agreement,
  * (_c_) a certified copy of the agreement,
  * (_d_) certified copies of the actuarial and
other reports upon which the agreement is
founded, and
  * (_e_) a declaration under the hands of the
president and manager of each company
that to the best of their knowledge and
belief every payment made or to be made
to any person whatever on account of the
agreement is therein fully set forth and
that no payments, other than those set
forth, have been made or are to be made in
money, policies, securities or other property
or valuable consideration, by or with the
knowledge of any of the parties to the
agreement.
(7) A company registered under Part III
shall not be permitted to amalgamate its
business with or to transfer its business to, or
to reinsure its business in any other company,
if the capital of the combined company after
such amalgamation, or of the continuing
company after such transfer or reinsurance,
would be impaired, nor shall any company so
registered and having an impaired capital be
permitted to purchase and take over the
business and property, or any portion thereof,
or to reinsure all or any portion of the policies
of any other company, whether so registered
or not, that transacts the business of life
insurance in Canada or elsewhere.
(8) A registered under Part III
company, whether so registered or not, unless
such amalgamation, transfer, or reinsurance
is sanctioned by the Treasury Board in
accordance with this section.
(9) This section does not apply to contracts
of reinsurance made by companies in the
ordinary course of their business. R.S., c. 31,
s. 90; 1960-61, c. 13, s. 19; 1964-65, c. 40, s. 12.

**91.** (1) Notwithstanding anything in its
.
,. ,
Act of incorporation or in any Act amending
such Act, or in this Act, a company that has
a capital stock and that is registered under
Part III to transact the business of life
insurance, whether alone or in combination
with any other class of insurance business,
may, with the permission of the Minister,
establish and implement a plan for the
conversion of the company into a mutual
company by the purchase of shares of the
capital stock of the company in accordance
with this section.
(2) The terms and provisions of any plan
referred to in subsection (1) shall be set forth
in detail in a by-law made by the directors
and confirmed at a special general meeting
of the company duly called for the purpose
of considering the by-law, and there shall be
recorded in the minutes of the meeting the
number of votes for and the number of votes
against confirmation of the by-law, the votes
of shareholders and the votes of policyholders
being recorded separately.
(3) N O such by-law is effective until sanc-
tioned by the Treasury Board, and in no case
shall any such by-law be sanctioned unless
the Treasury Board is satisfied that
  * (_a_) the conversion of the company into a
mutual company may reasonably be expect
ed to be achieved under the terms of the
by-law and in accordance with this section ;
(6) the paid-up capital of the company has
ceased to be an important factor in
safeguarding the interests of the policy-
holders of the company, having regard to
the quality and amount of the assets of the
company, the surplus of the company
relative to its liabilities, the nature of the
business carried on by the company and
any other considerations deemed by the
Treasury Board to be relevant ;
  * (_c_) the majority of the votes cast by
shareholders and the majority of the votes
cast by pohcyholders at the special general
meeting referred to in subsection (2),
whether in person or by proxy, were in
favour of confirmation of the by-law ;
  * (_d_) the company holds offers from share
holders, in such terms as to preclude the
withdrawal thereof prior to notice by the
company in accordance with subsection (14),
to sell to the company, at a price fixed by
the directors, not less than 25% of all issued
and outstanding shares of the capital stock
of the company immediately upon the
sanction of the by-law by the Treasury
Board, or not less than 50% of all issued
and outstanding shares of the capital stock
of the company within such period com
mencing immediately upon the sanction of
the by-law by the Treasury Board as is
specified in the by-law ;
  * (_e_) the amount required to purchase 25% of
the issued and outstanding shares of the
capital stock of the company at the price
fixed by the directors for the purposes of
paragraph (d) does not exceed the maximum
amount, determined in accordance with
subsection (10), that may be applied by the
company, immediately upon the sanction
of the by-law by the Treasury Board, in
payment for shares purchased under the
terms of the by-law ; and
  * (_f_) the price fixed by the directors for the
purposes of paragraph (d) is fair and
reasonable in the circumstances.
^ Upon the sanction of tne by-law by tne
Treasury Board, the price fixed for the
purposes of paragraph (3)(d) continues to be
the price that may be paid for shares
purchased under the terms of the by-law until
such price is changed by the directors in
accordance with subsection (5).
(5) ^he directors mav from time to time
change , the price to be paid i jr for shares i 
purchased under the terms of the by-law, but
no such change is effective until approved by
the Minister, on the report of the Superin
tendent.
f
(6) Thg P " Ce flXed ^ th(? P Ur P OSeS
(3)(d) and any subsequent change
in price approved in accordance with subsec
tion (5) shall remain in effect for a period of
not less than six months from the date of
of the by-law or the date of approval
by the Minister, as the case may be.
(7) All shares purchased under the terms of
the by-law shall be paid for by the company
in full at the time of the purchase thereof,
but nothing in this subsection shall be
construed as prohibiting the company from
applying in payment for any shares so
purchased the full amount of the purchase
price thereof by promissory note, payable at
a fixed or determinable future time not later
than ten years from the date of the making
thereof and bearing a rate of interest fixed
by the directors and approved by the Minister
on the report of the Superintendent.
  * (_g_) The by-law shall fix a day ~ for the
/ i e , \
commencement 01 purchase ot shares under
the terms of the by-law, which day shall be
not sooner than the day following the day
the by-law is sanctioned by the Treasury
Board.
(9) Subject to subsection (10), the company
shall purchase all shares offered for sale under
the terms of the by-law on the day or days
fixed by the terms of the offer in each case
for the sale of those shares and at the price
in effect on the day the offer was received or
the day fixed by the by-law for the purposes
of subsection (8), whichever is the later, except
that no such purchase shall be made prior to
the day so fixed by the by-law.
(10) Notwithstanding anything in this sec
tion, the maximum amount that may be
applied by the company at any particular
time in payment for shares purchased under
the terms of the by-law is the amount by
which
  * (_a_) the aggregate of the surplus and general
or contingency reserves of the company,
after deducting the excess of the book value
over the par value of any shares purchased
under the terms of the by-law on or before
the date as of which the condition and
affairs of the company are required to be
shown in the most recent annual statement
deposited as required by this Act in the
Department,
exceeds the aggregate of
(6) 6% of the total assets of the company,
or such lesser percentage of the total assets
of the company as may be approved by the
Treasury Board, upon application by the
company, as safe and reasonable in the
circumstances having regard to the bases
and methods used in the computation of
the policy reserves of the company, the
quality of its assets, the nature of the
business transacted by the company, the
earnings of the company and any other
matters deemed by the Treasury Board to
be relevant thereto, and
  * (_c_) the total amount applied by the compa
ny before that particular time in payment
for any shares purchased under the terms
of the by-law after the date referred to in
paragraph (a).
(11) For the purposes of subsection (10), the
assets, surplus and general or contingency
reserves of the company and the book value
of any shares purchased under the terms of
the by-law shall be taken as shown in the
annual statement referred to in paragraph
(lOXo).
(12) Where, by reason of subsection (10),
. , i ,
the company may, at any particular time,
purchase some but not all of the shares in
respe ct of which offers for sale at that time
have been received, the amount that may be
applied by the company at that time in
payment for shares purchased under the terms
of the by-law shall be applied by the company
by apportionment among all of the shares so
offered for sale at that time, or any of them,
in such manner as is specified in the by-law.
(13) The company shall cause a register to
be kept in which shall be recorded the offers
for sale of shares under the terms of the by
law in the order in which such offers are
received by the company, showing, in respect
of each such offer,

the offer,
(6) the name and address of the shareholder
making the offer,
. (c) the number of shares so offered by the
shareholder making the offer, and the day
or days fixed by the terms of the offer for
the sale of those shares,
  * (_d_) the price at which each of the shares so
shares purchased, and
(/) the date of withdrawal, if any, of the
offer and the number of shares affected
thereby.
(14) Where, by reason of subsection (10),
the company is required to discontinue the
purchase of shares under the terms of the by
law, the company shall give notice of such
discontinuance to each shareholder on the
register whose offer for the sale of shares has
not been fully taken up by the company, but
any such offer with respect to shares not so
purchased continues to be effective and
maintains its place on the register until
withdrawn by the shareholder by notice in
writing to the company.
(15) Where the company has purchased any
shares of the capital stock of the company
under the terms of the by-law,
  * (_a_) the number of policyholders directors
of the company shall at all times thereafter
be not less than
  * (_i_) one-third of the total number of
directors, or
  * (_ii_) that proportion of the total number
of directors, as nearly as may be, that the
total number of shares purchased under
the terms of the by-law is of the total
number of shares outstanding immediate
ly prior to the sanction of the by-law by
the Treasury Board,
whichever is the greater, except that noth
ing in this paragraph shall be held to
require an increase in the number of
policyholders directors except as vacancies
occur among the shareholders directors;
  * (_b_) the company shall not thereafter sell
any of the shares so purchased, issue any
new capital stock or make any calls on
shares of the capital stock subscribed ;
  * (_c_) any dividends thereafter payable to
shareholders shall be at a rate not less than
the average rate paid in the three years
immediately preceding the sanction of the
by-law by the Treasury Board, unless the
company establishes to the satisfaction of
the Minister that a reduction therein is
justified by reason of the earnings and
general financial condition of the company ;
and
  * (_d_) shares purchased under the terms of the
by-law rank equally with other shares in
the declaration of dividends to shareholders,
but any dividends that may be payable in
respect of shares so purchased shall be paid
by transfer of the applicable amount from
the shareholders account to the insurance
funds of the company.
(16) In respect of each share purchased
under the terms of the by-law, until the
capital stock of the company has been
cancelled in accordance with subsection (21),
  * (_a_) the company may include in its assets
shown in the annual statement required by
this Act to be deposited in the Department
an amount not exceeding the purchase price
of the share, minus one-fifth of the excess
of the purchase price over the par value
thereof for each complete year that has
elapsed since the date of purchase of the
share ; and
(6) the policyholders directors shall have
additional voting rights corresponding to
the voting rights that might have been
exercised by the holder of the share if he
had not sold it, and, unless the by-law
otherwise provides, such additional voting
rights shall be divided as nearly as may be
equally among the policyholders directors
and the remainder, if any, shall be exercised
by such one of the policyholders directors
as is designated for the purpose by resolution
of all of the directors.
(17) At v,;eh time as the company first
acquires 90^ or more of the shares of its
capital stock, it shall notify the Minister and
each of the remaining shareholders of the
company to that effect, and, for the purposes
of this subsection, notice to any shareholder
shall be deemed to have been given by the
company if the company has forwarded to
him by registered mail, at his address shown
in the book or books referred to in section 15,
the notice required by this subsection.
(18) The notice required by subsection (17)
to be given to each of the remaining
shareholders of the company shall request
each such shareholder to offer his shares for
forthwith to the company, and shall state
the substance of subsection (19).
(jQ) All shares of a shareholder remaining
outstanding at the expiration of six months
from the date of the notice required by
subsection (17), or at the expiration of such
further period as may be required by reason
of subsection (10), shall, upon tender by the
company to the shareholder of an amount
equal to the price in effect,
  * (_a_) in the case of shares in respect of which
any offer for sale was received by the
company prior to the date of the notice, on
the day the offer was received, or
(6) in the case of any other shares, on the
date of the notice,
be deemed to have been purchased by the
company, and, for the purposes of this
subsection, tender shall be deemed to have
been made to a shareholder by the company
if made to him in person or by registered mail
forwarded to him at his address shown in the
book or books referred to in section 15.
(20) Where tender of an amount in accord-
ance with subsection (19) has been made and
the amount so tendered has not been accepted,
the amount so tendered shall be retained by
the company for payment to the person
entitled thereto, and until so paid shall be
shown on the books of the company as a
liability thereof.
(21) Where the company has purchased or
* s deemed by subsection (19) to have purchased
all of the shares of the capital stock of the
company and the shares have been written
down in the books of the company to their
par value, the capital stock of the company
shall thereupon be retired and cancelled by
resolution of the board of directors and the
company then becomes a mutual company

as a condition of being registered, file in the
Department with its application for registra

required by the Minister that it will, if granted
registration, and so long as registered, submit
to and comply with all the provisions of this
Act applicable to it in respect of the class or
classes of insurance specified in the certificate
of registry granted to it and the terms of such
certificate.
(2) The Minister may also require of even-
provincial company, as a condition of regis
tration as aforesaid, or of renewal thereof,
that the undertaking mentioned in subsection
(1) shall stipulate for submission and compli
ance by the provincial company to and with
the provisions of section 84 as if it were a
company, as defined by section 2.
(3) Where any provincial company regis
tered under this Part after stipulation as to
submission and compliance as provided by

stipulation, the Superintendent shall report,
and the Minister may act, in all respects as if
the provincial company had violated a
provision of this Act applicable thereto. R.S.,
c. 31,s. 151.

**152.** (1) Where the name of any provincial
company applying to be registered is in the

Act, or of any corporation registered under
the Foreign Insurance Companies Act, or a
name liable to be confounded with the
name of any such company, British compa

able,
the Superintendent shall so report to the

of conducting such hearing, the Superintend

under Part I of the Inquiries Act.
(3) The Minister, after consideration of the
report of the Superintendent and of the
evidence, if any, adduced before him, may
refuse to register the company.

register the company is based upon any of
the grounds of objection set forth in paragraph
(l)(a), an appeal shall, in such case but in no
other, lie in a summary manner to the
Exchequer Court of Canada, which has power
to make all necessary rules for the conduct of
appeals under this subsection ; and subsection

appeal, except that wherever the word
"Superintendent" appears in that subsection
there shall, for the purposes of every such
appeal, be substituted the word "Minister".
(5) From any final judgment given by the
Exchequer Court of Canada upon any appeal
brought before that Court under this section,
any of the interested parties, including the
Crown, may, within fifteen days from the day
on which such judgment has been given,
appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.
R.S., c. 31, s. 152.

**153.** The Minister may, ^ on the application
deposit that would be required of a company
applying to be registered in respect of the
class or classes of insurance, register
provincial company under this Part and
grant it a certificate of registry, but if the
certificate of registry of a provincial company
is limited to one or more of the provinces of
Canada, and if the laws of the province by
which it is incorporated provide that a
provincial company may transact its business
within that province only if it holds a licence
or certificate of registry under this Act, the
deposit required to be made by such provincial
company may be of such an amount, less
than the amount that would otherwise be
required under this Act, as the Treasury
Board on the report of the Superintendent
may specify, but at no time less than the
amount of the reserve on the business in force
in such provincial company on the 31st day
of December next preceding computed as
hereinbefore in this Act provided. R.S., c. 31,
s. 153.

**154.** Where any provincial company regis
tered under this Part violates any of the
provisions of this Act applicable thereto, the
Superintendent shall report the same to the
Minister and thereupon the Minister may in
his discretion, after a reasonable time has
been given to the company to be heard,
withdraw the company s certificate of registry.

sections 82, 85, 101, and 102, subsections
103(1 ),(2) and (5), section 104 and sections 107
to 115 apply, mutatis mutandis, to every
provincial company, registered under this
Part to transact any class or classes of
insurance business, to the same extent as they
are applicable to or in respect of a company
registered to transact the same class or classes
of insurance business under Part III, but, to
the extent to which any provision of the said
sections would effect an enlargement in any
respect of the corporate powers or rights of
any provincial company under its constating
instrument, such provision does not apply to
the provincial company. 1960-61, c. 13, s. 28.

the difference between the then value of the sum assured
thereunder (including the then value of any bonus or addi
tion thereto, or reduction in future premiums, made after the
date of issue of the policy and subsisting as at the date of
valuation), and the then value of the valuation premium (as
hereinafter defined) assumed to be payable on each anniversary
of the policy following the date of valuation during the term
for which premiums are required to be paid in accordance with
the terms of the policy to be valued.
If the net level premium for the life insurance risks incurred
by the company in issuing the policy does not exceed the
whole life net level premium for a like amount of whole life
insurance, the valuation premium shall be the net level
premium for a like policy as of an age one year greater than
the age at entry assumed to be payable at the beginning of
the second and each subsequent policy year for which premi
ums are payable under the terms of the policy to be valued.
If the net level premium for the life insurance risks incurred
by the company in issuing the policy exceeds the net level
premium payable throughout life for a like amount of whole
life insurance, the valuation premium shall be obtained by
adding to each net level annual premium, excluding the first,
an amount, assumed to be payable at the beginning of the
and each subsequent policy year for which premiums
payable under the terms of the policy to be valued, as is
equal in value as of the date of issue of ,the policy to the differ

term, as is equal in then present value to the insurance risks
incurred by the company as from the attainment of the

the assumed age at issue the value of the policy shall be the
difference between the then value of the sums assured (includ
ing the then value of any bonus or addition thereto, or
reduction in future premiums, made after the date of issue
of the policy and subsisting as of the date of valuation), and
