and Photometric Units Act. R.S., c. 92, s. 1.

## ELECTRICAL UNITS

**2.** The units of electrical measure for
Canada are as follows :
  * (_a_) for electric current, the "ampere", which
is the current that, when constantly main
tained in two straight parallel conductors
of infinite length, of infinitesimal circular
sections and placed one centimetre apart in
a vacuum, will produce a force equal to two
one-hundredths of a dyne per centimetre of
length, a dyne being that force which,
acting on one gramme for one second,
generates a velocity of one centimetre per
second ;
(6) for difference of potential and for
electromotive force, the "volt", which is the
difference of electric potential between two
points of a conductor that is carrying a
constant current of one ampere, when the
power dissipated between the points is equal
to one watt ;
  * (_c_) for electrical resistance, the "ohm",
which is the electrical resistance between
two points of a metallic conductor, when a
constant difference of potential of one volt,
applied between these two points, produces
in the conductor a current of one ampere
and the conductor itself is not the seat of
any electromotive force ;
  * (_d_) for quantity of electricity, the "cou-
one ampere ;
  * (_e_) for electrical capacitance, the "farad",
which is the capacitance of a capacitor
between the plates of which there appears
a difference of potential of one volt, when
the capacitor is charged by a quantity of
electricity equal to one coulomb ;
(/) for electrical inductance, the "henry",
which is the inductance of a closed circuit
in which an electromotive force of one volt
is produced when the electric current in the
circuit varies uniformly at a rate of one
ampere per second ;
  * (_gf_) for electric power, the "watt", which is
the power that will produce energy at the
rate of one joule per second, a joule being
the energy dissipated when the point of
application of a force of ten million dynes
is displaced a distance of one centimetre in
the direction of the force ; and
(/i) for electrical energy, the "kilowatt-
hour", which is the energy supplied by a
power of one thousand watts operating for
one hour. R.S., c. 92, s. 2.

## PHOTOMETRIC UNITS

**3.** The units of photometric measure for
Canada are as follows :
  * (_a_) for intensity of light, the "candle",
which is one sixtieth of the intensity of one
square centimetre of a perfect radiator
(known as a "black body"), when operated
at the temperature of freezing platinum ;
and
(6) for flux of light, the "lumen", which is
the flux in a unit of solid angle from a
source of which the intensity is one candle.
R.S., c. 92, s. 3.

## STANDARDS

**4.** (1) The National Research Council of
Canada shall maintain standards calibrated
in terms of electrical units and photometric
units defined in this Act.
(2) Reference standards for the units of
and photometric measure estab
mentioned in subsection (1) and shall serve as
standards for the purposes of the Electricity
Inspection Act, shall be deposited by the
National Research Council in the Department
of Consumer and Corporate Affairs. R.S., c.
92, s. 4 ; 1968-69, c. 28, s. 104.
