# CHAPTER M-3
An Act respecting the Canadian National
Railways and the tariffs of tolls to be
charged on certain Eastern lines
j. T n i s Act may be cited as the Maritime
Freight Rates Act. R.S., c. 174, s. 1.

**2.** For the purposes of this Act the lines of
railway now operated as a part of the
Canadian National Railways and situated
within the Provinces of New Brunswick, Nova
Scotia and Prince Edward Island, and the
lines of railway, similarly operated, in the
Province of Quebec extending from the
southern provincial boundary near Matapedia
and near Courchesne to Diamond Junction
and Levis are collectively designated as the
"Eastern lines". R.S., c. 174, s. 2.

**3.** (j) All persons or companies controlling,
j , i j
or concerned in the preparation and issue 01
tariffs of tolls to be charged in respect of the
movement of freight traffic, whether on behalf
of Her Majesty or otherwise, upon or over the
Eastern lines specified in section 4, and
hereinafter called "preferred movements", are
hereby authorized and directed upon and
after the 1st day of July 1927
  * (_a_) to cancel all existing freight tariffs in
respect of such preferred movements ; and
(6) to substitute other tariffs for the tariffs
so cancelled showing a reduction in such
tariffs of approximately twenty per cent.
(2) The Canadian Transport Commission
called the Commission) is author
and directed
  * (_a_) to approve such cancellations, and,
subject to the provisions of the Railway Act,
respecting tariffs of tolls for the carriage of
freight, where not inconsistent with this
Act, to approve all tariffs of tolls so
substituted ;
  * (_b_) to maintain or cause to be maintained
such substituted tariffs, subject to all
provisions of the Railway Act respecting
tariffs of tolls not inconsistent with this
Act, on the general rate level of approxi
mately twenty per cent below the tolls or
rates existing on the 1st day of July 1927,
while the cost of railway operation in
Canada remains approximately the same
as at that date, but the Commission may
allow the increase or reduction of such tolls
or tariffs from time to time to meet increases
or reductions, as the case may be, in such
cost of operations; and
  * (_c_) to adjust or vary such substituted tolls
or rates from time to time as new industrial
or traffic conditions arise, but always in
conformity with the intent of this Act as
expressed in sections 6 and 7 and other
relative sections.
(3) Since questions may arise whether
substituted tariffs prepared and submitted to
the Commission are consistent or not consist
ent with this Act, it is declared that the
finding of the Commission that any tariff so
substituted and approved is inconsistent shall
take effect only upon such finding, and the
tariff in question shall be deemed to be the
lawful tariff until disallowed by the Commis
sion as inconsistent, and until a proper
substituted tariff satisfactory to the Commis
sion is filed and approved. R.S., c. 174, s. 3;
1957, c. 14, s. 12; 1966-67, c. 69, s. 88.

**4.** (1) The following are preferred move-
ments as referred to in section 3 and other
sections :
  * (_a_) local traffic, all rail between points on
the Eastern lines; for example, Sydney to
Newcastle ;
  * (_b_) traffic moving outward, westbound, all
rail from points on the Eastern lines
westbound to points in Canada beyond the
limit of the Eastern lines at Diamond
Junction or Levis; for example, Moncton
to Montreal the twenty per cent reduction
shall be based upon the Eastern lines
proportion of the through rate or in this
example upon the rate applicable from
Moncton west as far as Diamond Junction
or Levis ;
  * (_c_) traffic moving outward, export traffic,
rail and sea from points on the Eastern
lines through ocean ports on the Eastern
lines destined overseas; for example, Fred-
ericton to Liverpool via Saint John the
rate affected shall be that applicable from
Fredericton to Saint John ; and
  * (_d_) traffic moving outward, westbound, rail-
and-lake, and also rail-lake-and-rail from
points on the Eastern lines westbound to
points in Canada via ports beyond the limit
of the Eastern lines at Diamond Junction
or Levis ; for example, Moncton to Winnipeg
via the port of Point Edward thence via
water to Thunder Bay the twenty per cent
shall be based upon the Eastern lines
proportion of the through rate for the rail
mileage from Moncton west as far as
Diamond Junction or Levis.
(2) Traffic moving over the car ferries shall
be treated as all rail traffic. R.S., c. 174, s. 4;
1957, c. 14, s. 12.

**5.** For greater clarity, but without intend
ing to enlarge by any omission the scope of
section 4, it is declared that the following are
not preferred movements :
  * (_a_) traffic moving inward or outward to or
from the United States, all rail from or to
points in the United States to or from
points on the Eastern lines;
(6) traffic moving inward, eastbound, from
Canada, all rail from points in Canada
not on the Eastern lines eastbound to points
on the Eastern lines; for example, Toronto
to Moncton;
  * (_c_) import traffic to Canada, originating at
points overseas; for example, Liverpool to
Moncton or to Toronto ; and
  * (_d_) passenger movements and express move
ments. R.S., c. 174, s. 5.

**6.** For the purposes of sections 276 and 277
of the Railway Act, a freight rate in respect
of preferred movements shall consist of the
rate specified in the tariff of tolls and the
amount of the compensation paid or to be
paid out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund
and attributable to that rate as determined
by the Commission. 1968-69, c. 52, s. 8.

**7.** The purpose of this Act is to give certain
statutory advantages in rates to persons and
industries in the three Provinces of New
Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward
Island, and in addition upon the lines in the
Province of Quebec mentioned in section 2,
all of which is hereinafter called "select
territory" ; accordingly the Commission shall
not approve nor allow any tariffs that may
destroy or prejudicially affect such advantages
in favour of persons or industries located
elsewhere than in such select territory. R.S.,
c. 174, s. 7.

**8.** (1) Other companies owning or operating
lines of railway in or extending into the select
territory may file with the Commission tariffs
of tolls respecting freight movements similar
to the preferred movements, meeting the
statutory rates referred to in section 6 ; and
the Commission, subject to all the provisions
of the Railway Act respecting tariff of tolls,
not inconsistent with this Act, shall approve
the tariffs of tolls filed under this section.
(2) The provisions of subsection 3(2) and of
sections 6 and 7 apply to the tariffs of tolls
filed under this section.
(3) The Minister of Transport shall author
ize the payment out of the Consolidated
Revenue Fund to a company to which this
section applies, on the certification of the
Commission, of an amount of compensation
for the reduction in rates maintained by the
company in a calendar year with respect to
tariffs approved by the Commission under
(1), in accordance with and subject
to such regulations as the Governor in Council
may prescribe. R.S., c. 174, s. 8; 1968-69, c. 52,
s. 8.

**9.** (1) Other lines of railway from time to
time operated within the select territory as
part of the Canadian National Railways may
be included within the Eastern lines as
designated in section 2 and made subject to
this Act by an order or orders of the Governor
in Council ; and any lines designated as
Eastern lines may upon such lines ceasing to
be operated as a part of the Canadian
National Railways, be from time to time
withdrawn from such designation of Eastern
lines by similar order or orders.
(2) The Governor in Council is hereby
authorized at any time or times at discretion
to pass any order in council for the purposes
and with the effect mentioned in this section.
