Parties on the Surface

## ROME
7 October 1952
THE STATES SIGNATORY to this Convention

persons who suffer damage caused on the surface by foreign
aircraft, while limiting in a reasonable manner the extent of the
liabilities incurred for such damage in order not to hinder the
development of international civil air transport, and also

## LOWS:
CHAPTER I
PRINCIPLES OF LIABILITY
Article 1

**1.** Any person who suffers damage on the surface shall, upon
proof only that the damage was caused by an aircraft in flight
or by any person or thing falling therefrom, be entitled to
compensation as provided by this Convention. Nevertheless
there shall be no right to compensation if the damage is not a
direct consequence of the incident giving rise thereto, or if the
damage results from the mere fact of passage of the aircraft
through the airspace in conformity with existing air traffic
regulations.

**2.** For the purpose of this Convention, an aircraft is considered
to be in flight from the moment when power is applied for the
purpose of actual take-off until the moment when the landing
run ends. In the case of an aircraft lighter than air, the
expression "in flight" relates to the period from the moment
when it becomes detached from the surface until it becomes
again attached thereto.
Article 2

**1.** The liability for compensation contemplated by Article 1
of this Convention shall attach to the operator of the aircraft.

**2.** (a) For the purposes of this Convention the term "operator"
shall mean the person who was making use of the aircraft at the
time the damage was caused, provided that if control of the
navigation of the aircraft was retained by the person from whom
the right to make use of the aircraft was derived, whether
directly or indirectly, that person shall be considered the
operator.
(6) A person shall be considered to be making use -of an
aircraft when he is using it personally or when his servants or
agents are using the aircraft in the course of their employment,
or not within the scope of their authority.

**3.** The registered owner of the aircraft shall be presumed to
the operator and shall be liable as such unless, in the
for the determination of his liability, he proves that
other person was the operator and, in so far as legal
permit, takes appropriate measures to make that
person a party in the proceedings.
Article 3
If the person who was the operator at the time the damage
was caused had not the exclusive right to use the aircraft for a
period of more than fourteen days, dating from the moment
when the right to use commenced, the person from whom such
right was derived shall be liable jointly and severally with the
operator, each of them being bound under the provisions and
within the limits of liability of this Convention.
Article 4
If a person makes use of an aircraft without the consent of
the person entitled to its navigational control, the latter, unless
he proves that he has exercised due care to prevent such use,
shall be jointly and severally liable with the unlawful user for
damage giving a right to compensation under Article 1, each of
them being bound under the provisions and within the limits of
liability of this Convention.
Article 5
Any person who would otherwise be liable under the provisions
of this Convention shall not be liable if the damage is the direct
consequence of armed conflict or civil disturbance, or if such
person has been deprived of the use of the aircraft by act of
public authority.
Article 6

**1.** Any person who would otherwise be liable under the
provisions of this Convention shall not be liable for damage if
he proves that the damage was caused solely through the
negligence or other wrongful act or omission of the person who
suffers the damage or of the latter s servants or agents. If the
person liable proves that the damage was contributed to by the
negligence or other wrongful act or omission of the person who
suffers the damage, or of his servants or agents, the compensation
shall be reduced to the extent to which such negligence or
wrongful act or omission contributed to the damage. Nevertheless
there shall be no such exoneration or reduction if, in the case of
the negligence or other wrongful act or omission of a servant or
agent, the person who suffers the damage proves that his servant
or agent was acting outside the scope of his authority.

**2.** When an action is brought by one person to recover
damages arising from the death or injury of another person, the
negligence or other wrongful act or omission of such other
person, or of his servants or agents, shall also have the effect
provided in the preceding paragraph.
Article 7
When two or more aircraft have collided or interfered with
each other in flight and damage for which a right to
compensation as contemplated in Article 1 results, or when two
or more aircraft have jointly caused such damage, each of the
aircraft concerned shall be considered to have caused the damage
and the operator of each aircraft shall be liable, each of them
being bound under the provisions and within the limits of
liability of this Convention.
Article 8
The persons referred to in paragraph 3 of Article 2 and in
3 and 4 shall be entitled to all defences which are
to an operator under the provisions of this Convention.
Article 9
Neither the operator, the owner, any person liable under
Article 3 or Article 4, nor their respective servants or agents,
shall be liable for damage on the surface caused by an aircraft
in flight or any person or thing falling therefrom otherwise than
as expressly provided in this Convention. This rule shall not
apply to any such person who is guilty of a deliberate act or
omission done with intent to cause damage.
Article 10
Nothing in this Convention shall prejudice the question
whether a person liable for damage in accordance with its
provisions has a right of recourse against any other person.
CHAPTER II
EXTENT OF LIABILITY
Article 11

**1.** Subject to the provisions of Article 12, the liability for
damage giving a right to compensation under Article 1, for each

less;
(6) 500,000 francs plus 400 francs per kilogramme over 1,000
kilogrammes for aircraft weighing more than 1,000 but not

kilogrammes for aircraft weighing more than 50,000 kilogrammes.

**2.** The liability in respect of loss of life or personal injury
shall not exceed 500,000 francs per person killed or injured.

**3.** "Weight" means the maximum weight of the aircraft
authorised by the certificate of airworthiness for take-off,
excluding the effect of lifting gas when used.

**4.** The sums mentioned in francs in this Article refer to a
currency unit consisting of 65J milligrammes of gold of
millesimal fineness 900. These sums may be converted into
national currencies in round figures. Conversion of the sums
into national currencies other than gold shall, in case of judicial
proceedings, be made according to the gold value of such
currencies at the date of the judgment, or, in cases covered by
Article 14, at the date of the allocation.
Article 12

**1.** If the person who suffers damage proves that it was caused
a deliberate act or omission of the operator, his servants or
agents, done with intent to cause damage, the liability of the
operator shall be unlimited ; provided that in the case of such
act or omission of such servant or agent, it is also proved that
he was acting in the course of his employment and within the
scope of his authority.

**2.** If a person wrongfully takes and makes use of an aircraft
without the consent of the person entitled to use it, his liability
shall be unlimited.
Article 13

**1.** Whenever, under the provisions of Article 3 or Article 4,
two or more persons are liable for damage, or a registered owner
who was not the operator is made liable as such as provided in
paragraph 3 of Article 2, the persons who suffer damage shall
not be entitled to total compensation greater than the highest
indemnity which may be awarded under the provisions of this
Convention against any one of the persons liable.

**2.** When the provisions of Article 7 are applicable, the person
who suffers the damage shall be entitled to be compensated up
to the aggregate of the limits applicable with respect to each of
the aircraft involved, but no operator shall be liable for a sum
in excess of the limit applicable to his aircraft unless his liability
is unlimited under the terms of Article 12.
Article 14
If the total amount of the claims established exceeds the limit
of liability applicable under the provisions of this Convention,
the following rules shall apply, taking into account the provisions
of paragraph 2 of Article 1 1 :
  * (_a_) If the claims are exclusively in respect of loss of life or
personal injury or exclusively in respect of damage to property,
such claims shall be reduced in proportion to their respective
amounts.
(6) If the claims are both in respect of loss of life or personal
injury and in respect of damage to property, one half of the
total sum distributable shall be appropriated preferentially to
meet claims in respect of loss of life and personal injury and, if
insufficient, shall be distributed proportionately between the
claims concerned. The remainder of the total sum distributable
shall be distributed proportionately among the claims in respect
of damage to property and the portion not already covered of
the claims in respect of loss of life and personal injury.
CHAPTER III
SECURITY FOR OPERATOR S LIABILITY
Article 15

**1.** Any Contracting State may require that the operator of an
aircraft registered in another Contracting State shall be insured
in respect of his liability for damage sustained in its territory
for which a right to compensation exists under Article 1 by
means of insurance up to the limits applicable according to the
provisions of Article 11.

**2.** (a) The insurance shall be accepted as satisfactory if it
to the provisions of this Convention and has been
by an insurer authorised to effect such insurance under
the laws of the State where the aircraft is registered or of the
State where the insurer has his residence or principal place of
business, and whose financial responsibility has been verified by
either of those States.
(6) If insurance has been required by any State under
paragraph 1 of this Article, and a final judgment in that State
is not satisfied by payment in the currency of that State, any
Contracting State may refuse to accept the insurer as financially
responsible until such payment, if demanded, has been made.

**3.** Notwithstanding the last preceding paragraph the State
overflown may refuse to accept as satisfactory insurance effected
by an insurer who is not authorised for that purpose in a
Contracting State.

**4.** Instead of insurance, any of the following securities shall
be deemed satisfactory if the security conforms to Article 17 :
  * (_a_) a cash deposit in a depository maintained by the
Contracting State where the aircraft is registered or with a bank
authorised to act as a depository by that State ;
(6) a guarantee given by a bank authorised to do so by the
Contracting State where the aircraft is registered, and whose
financial responsibility has been verified by that State ;
  * (_c_) a guarantee given by the Contracting State where the
aircraft is registered, if that State undertakes that it will not
claim immunity from suit in respect of that guarantee.

**5.** Subject to paragraph 6 of this Article, the State overflown
may also require that the aircraft shall carry a certificate issued
by the insurer certifying that insurance has been effected in
accordance with the provisions of this Convention, and specifying
the person or persons whose liability is secured thereby, together
with a certificate or endorsement issued by the appropriate
authority in the State where the aircraft is registered or in the
State where the insurer has his residence or principal place of
business certifying the financial responsibility of the insurer. If
other security is furnished in accordance with the provisions of
paragraph 4 of this Article, a certificate to that effect shall be
issued by the appropriate authority in the State where the
aircraft is registered.

**6.** The certificate referred to in paragraph 5 of this Article
need not be carried in the aircraft if a certified copy has been
filed with the appropriate authority designated by the State
overflown or, if the International Civil Aviation Organization
agrees, with that Organization, which shall furnish a copy of the
certificate to each contracting State.

**7.** (a) Where the State overflown has reasonable grounds for
doubting the financial responsibility of the insurer, or of the
bank which issues a guarantee under paragraph 4 of this Article,
that State may request additional evidence of financial
responsibility, and if any question arises as to the adequacy of
that evidence the dispute affecting the States concerned shall,
at the request of one of those States, be submitted to an arbitral
tribunal which shall be either the Council of the International
Civil Aviation Organization or a person or body mutually
agreed by the parties.
(6) Until this tribunal has given its decision the insurance or
guarantee shall be considered provisionally valid by the State
overflown.

**8.** Any requirements imposed in accordance with this Article
shall be notified to the Secretary General of the International
Civil Aviation Organization who shall inform each Contracting
State thereof.

**9.** For the purpose of this Article, the term "insurer" includes
group of insurers, and for the purpose of paragraph 5 of this
the phrase "appropriate authority in a State" includes
appropriate authority in the highest political subdivision
which regulates the conduct of business by the insurer.
Article 16

**1.** The insurer or other person providing security required
under Article 15 for the liability of the operator may, in addition
to the defences available to the operator, and the defence of
forgery, set up only the following defences against claims based
on the application of this Convention :
  * (_a_) that the damage occurred after the security ceased to be
effective. However, if the security expires during a flight, it
shall be continued in force until the next landing specified in
the flight plan, but no longer than twenty-four hours; and if
the security ceases to be effective for any reason other than the
expiration of its term, or a change of operator, it shall be
continued until fifteen days after notification to the appropriate
authority of the State which certifies the financial responsibility
of the insurer or the guarantor that the security has ceased to
be effective, or until effective withdrawal of the certificate of
the insurer or the certificate of guarantee if such a certificate
has been required under paragraph 5 of Article 15, whichever is
the earlier;
  * (_b_) that the damage occurred outside the territorial limits
provided for by the security, unless flight outside of such limits
was caused by force majeure, assistance justified by the
circumstances, or an error in piloting, operation or navigation.

**2.** The State which has issued or endorsed a certificate
pursuant to paragraph 5 of Article 15 shall notify the termination
or cessation, otherwise than by the expiration of its term, of the
insurance or other security to the interested contracting States
as soon as possible.

**3.** Where a certificate of insurance or other security is required
under paragraph 5 of Article 15 and, the operator is changed
during the period of the validity of the security, the security
shall apply to the liability under this Convention of the new
operator, unless he is already covered by other insurance or
security or is an unlawful user, but not beyond fifteen days
from the time when the insurer or guarantor notifies the
appropriate authority of the State where the certificate was
issued that the security has become ineffective or until the
effective withdrawal of the certificate of the insurer if such a
certificate has been required under paragraph 5 of Article 15,
whichever is the shorter period.

**4.** The continuation in force of the security under the
provisions of paragraph 1 of this Article shall apply only for the
benefit of the person suffering damage.

**5.** Without prejudice to any right of direct action which he
may have under the law governing the contract of insurance or
guarantee, the person suffering damage may bring a direct
action against the insurer or guarantor only in the following
qases:
  * (_a_) where the security is continued in force under the
provisions of paragraph l(a) and (6) of this Article ;
  * (_b_) the bankruptcy of the operator.

**6.** Excepting the defences specified in paragraph 1 of this
Article, the insurer or other person providing security may not,
with respect to direct actions brought by the person suffering
damage based upon application of this Convention, avail
himself of any grounds of nullity or any right of retroactive
cancellation.

**7.** The provisions of this Article shall not prejudice the
whether the insurer or guarantor has a right of recourse
any other person.
Article 17

**1.** If security is furnished in accordance with paragraph 4 of
Article 15, it shall be specifically and preferentially assigned to
payment of claims under the provisions of this Convention.

**2.** The security shall be deemed sufficient if, in the case of an
operator of one aircraft, it is for an amount equal to the limit
applicable according to the provisions of Article 11, and in the
case of an operator of several aircraft, if it is for an amount not
less than the aggregate of the limits of liability applicable to
the two aircraft subject to the highest limits.

**3.** As soon as notice of a claim has been given to the operator,
the amount of the security shall be increased up to a total sum
equivalent to the aggregate of :
  * (_a_) the amount of the security then required by paragraph 2
of this Article, and
(6) the amount of the claim not exceeding the applicable limit
of liability.
This increased security shall be maintained until every claim
has been disposed of.
Article 18
Any sums due to an operator from an insurer shall be exempt
from seizure and execution by creditors of the operator until
claims of third parties under this Convention have been satisfied.
CHAPTER IV
RULES OF PROCEDURE AND LIMITATION OF ACTIONS
Article 19
If a claimant has not brought an action to enforce his claim
or if notification of such claim has not been given to the
operator within a period of six months from the date of the
incident which gave rise to the damage, the claimant shall only
be entitled to compensation out of the amount for which the
operator remains liable after all claims made within that period
have been met in full.
Article 20

**1.** Actions under the provisions of this Convention may be
brought only before the courts of the Contracting State where
the damage occurred. Nevertheless, by agreement between any
one or more claimants and any one or more defendants, such
claimants may take action before the courts of any other
Contracting State, but no such proceedings shall have the effect
of prejudicing in any way the rights of persons who bring actions
in the State where the damage occurred. The parties may also
agree to submit disputes to arbitration in any Contracting State.

**2.** Each Contracting State shall take all necessary measures
ensure that the defendant and all other parties interested are
of any proceedings concerning them and have a fair
adequate opportunity to defend their interests.

**3.** Each Contracting State shall so far as possible ensure that
all actions arising from a single incident and brought in
accordance with paragraph 1 of this Article are consolidated for
disposal in a single proceeding before the same court.

**4.** Where any final judgment, including a judgment by
default, is pronounced by a court competent in conformity with
this Convention, on which execution can be issued according to
the procedural law of that court, the judgment shall be
enforceable upon compliance with the formalities prescribed by
the laws of the Contracting State, or of any territory, State or
province thereof, where execution is applied for:
  * (_a_) in the Contracting State where the judgment debtor has
his residence or principal place of business or,
(6) if the assets available in that State and in the State where
the judgment was pronounced are insufficient to satisfy the
judgment, in any other Contracting State where the judgment
debtor has assets.

**5.** Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 4 of this
Article, the court to which application is made for execution
may refuse to issue execution if it is proved that any of the
following circumstances exist :
  * (_a_) the judgment was given by default and the defendant did
not acquire knowledge of the proceedings in sufficient time to
act upon it ;
(6) the defendant was not given a fair and adequate
opportunity to defend his interests ;
  * (_c_) the judgment is in respect of a cause of action which had
already, as between the same parties, formed the subject of a
judgment or an arbitral award which, under the law of the State
where execution is sought, is recognized as final and conclusive ;
  * (_d_) the judgment has been obtained by fraud of any of the
parties ;
  * (_e_) the right to enforce the judgment is not vested in the
person by whom the application for execution is made.

**6.** The merits of the case may not be reopened in proceedings
for execution under paragraph 4 of this Article.

**7.** The court to which application for execution is made may
also refuse to issue execution if the judgment concerned is
contrary to the public policy of the State in which execution is
requested.

**8.** If, in proceedings brought according to paragraph 4 of this
Article, execution of any judgment is refused on any of the
grounds referred to in subparagraphs (a), (6) or (d) of paragraph
5 or paragraph 7 of this Article, the claimant shall be entitled
to bring a new action before the courts of the State where
execution has been refused. The judgment rendered in such new
action may not result in the total compensation awarded
exceeding the limits applicable under the provisions of this
Convention. In such new action the previous judgment shall be
a defence only to the extent to which it has been satisfied. The
previous judgment shall cease to be enforceable as soon as the
new action has been started.
to a new action under this shall,
Article, the court to which application for execution is made
shall refuse execution of any judgment rendered by a court of a
State other than that in which the damage occurred until all
the judgments rendered in that State have been satisfied.
The court applied to shall also refuse to issue execution until
final judgment has been given on all actions filed in the State
where the damage occurred by those persons who have complied
with the time limit referred to in Article 19, if the judgment
debtor proves that the total amount of compensation which
might be awarded by such judgments might exceed the applicable
limit of liability under the provisions of this Convention.
Similarly such court shall not grant execution when, in the
case of actions brought in the State where the damage occurred
by those persons who have complied with the time limit referred
to in Article 19, the aggregate of the judgments exceeds the
applicable limit of liability, until such judgments have been
reduced in accordance with Article 14.

**10.** Where a judgment is rendered enforceable under this
Article, payment of costs recoverable under the judgment shall
also be enforceable. Nevertheless the court applied to for
execution may, on the application of the judgment debtor, limit
the amount of such costs to a sum equal to ten per centum of the
amount for which the judgment is rendered enforceable. The
limits of liability prescribed by this Convention shall be
exclusive of costs.

**11.** Interest not exceeding four per centum per annum may be
allowed on the judgment debt from the date of the judgment in
respect of which execution is granted.

**12.** An application for execution of a judgment to which
paragraph 4 of this Article applies must be made within five
years from the date when such judgment became final.
Article 21

**1.** Actions under this Convention shall be subject to a period
of limitation of two years from the date of the incident which
caused the damage.

**2.** The grounds for suspension or interruption of the period
referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall be determined by
the law of the court trying the action ; but in any case the right
to institute an action shall be extinguished on the expiration of
three years from the date of the incident which caused the
damage.
