## APPEAL

**12.** (1) Where the compensation awarded
to a person for any plant or other matter
destroyed or prohibited or restricted from sale

property or premises is less than the maximum
compensation prescribed under this Act or
where no compensation is awarded to such a
person, an appeal may be brought by that
person to the Assessor appointed under Part
II of the Pesticide Residue Compensation Act

tion awarded or the failure to award compen
sation was unreasonable.

dealt with, and nothing in this Act shall be
construed to prevent the legislature of any
province from making laws in relation to any
matter or any aspect of a matter not so dealt
with by this Act or by the Governor in
Council, or to render repugnant to this Act or
the regulations any law made by the
legislature of any province in relation to any
matter or any aspect of a matter not so dealt
by this Act or by the Governor in
Council ; but the power of the Governor in
