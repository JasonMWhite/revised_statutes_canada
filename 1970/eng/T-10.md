**17.** (1) No application for registration of a

ground of any previous use or making known
of a confusing trade mark or trade name by a
person other than the applicant for such
registration or his predecessor in title, except
at the instance of such other person or his
successor in title, and the burden lies on such
other person or his successor to establish that
he had not abandoned such confusing trade
mark or trade name at the date of advertise-
ment of the applicant's application.
(2) In proceedings commenced after the
expiry of five years from the date of
registration of a trade mark or from the Ist
held invalid on the ground of the previous

entitled to secure the registration.

trade mark to its exclusive use shall be deemed
to be infringed by a person not entitled to its
use under this Act who sells, distribut es or
advertises wares or services in association with

of a trade mark prevents a person
from making
  * (_a_) any bona fide use of his personal name
as a trade name, or
  * (_fa_) any bona fide use, other than as a trade
mark,
  * (_i_) of the geographical name of his place
of business, or
  * (_ii_) of any accurate description of the
character or quality of his wares or

attaching to the trade mark. 1952-53, c. 49, s.

parties to the proceedings, other than the
registered owner of the trade mark, had in
good faith used a confusing trade mark or
trade name in Canada before the date of
filing of the application for such registration,
and the Court considers that it is not contrary
to the public interest that the continued use
of the confusing trade mark or trade name
should be permitted in a defined territorial
area concurrently with the use of the registered
trade mark, it may, subject to such terms as
it deems just, order that such other party may
continue to use the confusing trade mark or
trade name within such area with an adéquate
specified distinction from the registered trade
mark.

under subsection (1) take effect only if, within

on the register in connection with the
registration of the registered trade mark. 1952-
53, c. 49, s. 21.

order the recovery of damages or profits and
may permit the défendant to continue to sell
wares marked with such trade mark that were
in his possession or under his control at the
time notice was given to him that the owner
of the registered trade mark complained of
such use. 1952-53, c. 49, s. 22.

license others to use the mark in association
with wares or services that meet the defined
standard, and the use of the mark accordingly
shall be deemed to be use thereof by the

mark may prevent its use by unlicensed
persons or in association with any wares or
services in respect of which such mark is
registered but to which the licence does not
extend.
(4) Where the owner of a registered certifi-
cation mark is an unincorporated body, any
action or proceeding to prevent unauthorized
use of such mark may be brought by any
member of such body on behalf of himself
and ail other members thereof. 1952-53, c. 49,
s. 23.

**24.** With the consent of the owner of a
certification mark, a trade mark confusing
with the certification mark may, if it exhibits
an appropriate différence, be registered by

tive authority of a country, state, province or
municipaUty including or forming part of the
area indicated by the mark, or is a commercial
association having an office or représentative
in such area ; but the owner of any mark
registered under this section shall permit the

ing any intervening use in Canada or making
known in Canada or any intervening applica-
tion or registration, if
  * (_a_) the application in Canada, including or

évidence other than such affidavit or statutory
déclaration, but may hear représentations
made by or on behalf of the registered owner
of the trade mark or by or on behalf of the
person at whose request the notice was given.

furnished to him or the failure to furnish such
évidence, it appears to the Registrar that the
trade mark, either with respect to ail of the
wares or services specified in the registration
or with respect to any of such wares or services,
is not in use in Canada and that the absence
of use bas not been due to spécial circumstances
that excuse such absence of use, the registra-

trade mark may call upon the owner thereof
to take proceedings for infringement thereof,
and, if the owner refuses or neglects to do so
within two months after being so called upon,

for infringement in his own name as if he
were the owner, making the owner a défend-
ant; but an owner so added as défendant is
not liable for any costs unless he takes part
in the proceedings.

tions proposed with respect to the charac-

  * (_e_) such further documents, information or
évidence as may be required by the
Registrar.

ensure that any document, information or
évidence furnished for the purpose of that

register, is not disclosed to any other person
except by order of a court.
(7) The Registrar may approve a person as
a registered user of the trade mark for any of
the proposed wares or services, subject to any
conditions or restrictions that he considers
proper, if he is satisfied that in ail the
circumstances the use of the trade mark in
association with such wares or services by the
proposed registered user would not be contrary
to the public interest.
(8) When a person has been approved as a
registered user of a trade mark, the Registrar
shall register him as such forthwith if the
trade mark is registered and, if the trade mark
is not registered, then concurrently with its
registration, and shall give notice of the
registration to any other registered user of
the trade mark.
(9) The registration of a person as a
registered user of a trade mark may be varied
by the Registrar as regards the wares or
services for which, or any conditions or
restrictions subject to which, it has effect, on
the application in writing of the registered
owner of the trade mark and not less than
one month after giving notice of such
application to such person and ail other
users, if the Registrar is satisfied
that in ail the circumstances such variation
not be contrary to the public interest.

registered user of a trade mark may be

respect of any wares or services for which
the trade mark is no longer registered ; or
  * (_c_) by the Exchequer Court of Canada upon
the application of any person, of which
notice is served upon the registered owner
and ail registered users, on any of the
following grounds :
  * (_i_) that the registered user has used the
trade mark otherwise than by way of the
permitted use, or in such a way as to
cause, or to be likely to cause, déception
or confusion,
  * (_ii_) that the owner or the registered user
misrepresented or failed to disclose some
fact that if accurately represented or
disclosed would hâve justified the Regis-
trar in refusing the application for
registration of the registered user,
  * (_iii_) that the circumstances hâve changed
since the date of the registration in such
a way that at the date of such application
for cancellation they would hâve justified
the Registrar in refusing the application
for registration of the registered user, or
  * (_iv_) that the registration ought not to
hâve been effected having regard to rights
vested in the applicant by virtue of a
contract in the performance of which he
is interested.

registered user of a trade mark any transférable
right to the use of such trade mark.

an opportunity of being heard personally or
by his agent. 1952-53, c. 49, s. 49.
