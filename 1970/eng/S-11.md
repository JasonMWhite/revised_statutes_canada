An Act respecting small loans
Whereas it has become the common prac-
tice for money-lenders to make charges against
borrowers claimed as discount, déduction from
an advance, commission, brokerage, chattel
mortgage and recording fées, fines and
penalties, or forinquiries, defaults orrenewals,
which, in truth and substance are, in whole or
in part, compensation for the use of money
loaned or for the acceptance of the risk of loss
or are so mixed with such compensation as to
be indistinguishable therefrom and are, in
some cases, charges primarily payable by the
lender but required by the lender to be paid
by the borrowers; and whereas the resuit of
thèse practices is to add to the cost of the
loan without increasing the nominal rate of
interest charged so that the provisions of the
law relating to interest and usury hâve been
rendered ineffective : Therefore His Majesty,
by and with the advice and consent of the
Senate and the House of Gommons of Canada,
enacts as follows :

c. 46, s. 1.

## PARTI
Money-lenders

**3.** (1) No money-lender shall, in respect of
any loan, directly or indirectly, charge, exact
or receive, or stipulate for the payment by
the borrower of, a sum of money as a resuit
of the payment of which the cost of the loan
exceeds an amount équivalent to the amount
or rate prescribed by this section, and any
money-lender who enters into a transaction
in contravention of this section, is guilty of
an offence and is liable on summary conviction
to a fine not exceeding one thousand dollars
or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding
one year, or to both.
(2) The cost of a loan shall not exceed the
aggregate of
  * (_a_) two per cent per month on any part of
the unpaid principal balance not exceedi.ng
three hundred dollars,
(6) one per cent per month on any part of
the unpaid principal balance exceeding
three hundred dollars but not exceeding
one thousand dollars, and
  * (_c_) one-half of one per cent per month on
any remainder of the unpaid principal
balance exceeding one thousand dollars.
(3) Where a loan of five hundred dollars or
less is made for a period greater than twenty
months or where a loan exceeding five
hundred dollars is made for a period greater
than thirty months, the cost of the loan shall
not exceed one per cent per month on the
unpaid principal balance thereof.
(4) Where a money-lender has made a loan
to a borrower and, while any part of the
balance thereof remains unpaid,
a loan to that borrower or that
spouse.
  * (_a_) if the aggregate of the unpaid principal
balances of such loans does not exceed
fifteen hundred dollars, the total cost of
such loans shall not thereafter exceed the
cost permitted under this section for a single
loan equal to such aggregate ; and
(6) if the aggregate of the unpaid principal
balances of such loans exceeds fifteen
hundred dollars, the total cost of such loans
shall not thereafter exceed the cost permit-
ted under this section for a loan of fifteen
hundred dollars, plus one-half of one per
cent per month on any part of such
aggregate in excess of fifteen hundred
dollars. 1956, c. 46, s. 2.

**4.** In any suit, action or other proceeding
concerning a loan wherein it is alleged that
the cost of the loan paid or claimed exceeds
the rate of cost prescribed by section 3, the
court may re-open the transaction and take
an account between the parties and may,
notwithstanding any statement or settlement
of account, or any contract purporting to close
previous dealings and create a new obligation,
re-open any account already taken between
the parties and relieve the borrower of any
obligation to pay any sum on account of the
cost of the loan in excess of an amount
équivalent to the said rate ; and if any such
excess has been paid or allowed, may order
the money-Iender to repay it and may set
aside, either in whole or in part, or revise, or
alter, any security given in respect of the
transaction. R.S., c. 251, s. 4.
Licences

**5.** (1) No person shall transact the business
of a money-lender unless such person has first
obtained from the Minister a licence ; but this
section does not apply to a money-lender the
cost of whose loans does not in any case
exceed an amount équivalent to one per cent
per month on the unpaid principal balance
thereof.

person upon being satisfied that the expéri-
ence, character, and gênerai fitness of such

of March in each year, but may be renewed
from year to year or for any term less than a

(5) The Minister shall cause to be published
in the first issue of the Canada Gazette in the

persons to whom licences hâve been issued as
aforesaid, and if any licence is issued or

publication of two such lists, notice thereof
shall be caused to be given in the Canada
Gazette by the Minister.
(6) Where any person makes application to
the Minister for the issue of a licence under
this section or for the renewal of such licence,
and such application is refused by the
Minister, the applicant has the right of appeal
to the Govemor in Council against the
décision of the Minister, and the Govemor in
Council, after such hearing as is deemed
necessary or désirable, shall render a décision
on the appeal, which décision is final. R.S., c.
251, s. 5; 1956, c. 46, s. 3.

**6.** (1) Every loan shall be repayable in
approximately equal instalments of principal
or of principal and cost of the loan at intervais

interest shall accrue thereon from the date of
default at the rate fixed by the contract as
the cost of the loan; but if default in the
payment of any instalment continues beyond
the date on which the last instalment of the
loan falls due, interest shall accrue thereon at
a rate not exceeding one per cent per month
from such date.
(2) The cost of any such loan or any part
thereof or any interest accruing after default
shall not be compounded or deducted or

repayment. R.S., c. 251, s. 6; 1956, c. 46, s. 4.
Inspection

**7.** (1) The Superintendent shall inspect

(2) Similarly, the Superintendent may in-
spect or authorize the inspection of any of
the branch offices of the licensees.
(3) To facilitate such inspection every
licensee shall on or before the Ist day of
March in each year prépare and file with the
Minister a statement in respect of the conduct
of the business of the licensee in such form as

his or its officers, agents and servants shall

time has been given to the licensee to be
and upon such further inquiry and
as he sees fit to make, reports to
Governor in Council that he agrées with
the opinion of the Superintendent, the
Governor in Council may suspend or cancel
the licence of the licensee. R.S., c. 251, s. 8.

**9.** For the purpose of ascertaining whether
this Act has been complied with, the Superin-
tendent may at any time investigate the loans
and business of any money-lender not licensed
under this Act, and every such money-lender
shall afford to the Superintendent free access
to the offices and places of business, books,
accounts, papers and records of such money-
lender and failure on the part of any such
money-lender to comply with this section
constitutes an offence against this Act. R.S.,
c. 251,s. 9.

**10.** The Superintendent shall annually
cause an assessment to be prepared against
each licensee under this Act for the purpose
of meeting the expense incurred by the
Government for or in connection with the
