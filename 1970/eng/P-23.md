permanent representative to the Organisation in the territory of
another Member State, and such members of his official staff

  * (_d_) the right to use codes and to receive and send papers or

country, to re-export such furniture and effects free of duty,
subject in either case to such conditions as the Government of
the country in which the right is being exercised may deem
necessary ;
  * (_i_) the right to import temporarily free of duty his private
motor vehicle for his own personal use and subsequently to
re-export such vehicle free of duty, subject in either case to
such conditions as the Government of the country concerned
may deem necessary.

**2.** Where the legal incidence of any form of taxation depends
upon residence, a period during which a representative to whom
this Article applies is present in the territory of another Member
State for the discharge of his duties shall not be considered as a
period of residence. In particular, he shall be exempt from
taxation on his official salary and emoluments during such
periods of duty.

**3.** In this Article "representative" shall be deemed to include
all representatives, advisers and technical experts of delegations.
Each Member State shall communicate to the other Member

States.

and can be waived without prejudice to the purposes for which
the immunity is accorded.

shall be exempt from taxation on the salaries and emoluments
paid to them by the Organisation in their capacity as such
officials. Any Member State may, however, conclude an
arrangement with the Council acting on behalf of the

seizure of their personal baggage ;
  * (_b_) in respect of words spoken or written or acts done by them
in the performance of their official functions for the
Organisation, immunity from legal process ;

restrictions and in respect of their personal baggage as are

in the interests of the Organisation and not for the personal
benefit of the individuals themselves. The Chairman of the

opinion, the immunity would impede the course of justice and
can be waived without prejudice to the interests of the
