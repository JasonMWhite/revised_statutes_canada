# CHAPTER C-13
An Act to establish the Cape Breton Devel
opment Corporation
WHEREAS it has been estimated that the
realistic working life of the Sydney coalfield
on the Island of Cape Breton is only about
fifteen years and that as a result of rising
operating costs, the future operation of the
mines in the coalfield will require the
continuation, on an increasing scale, of the
subsidies and other governmental assistance
that have been provided over a period of
almost forty years, in order to retain any
market for the coal produced from the mines ;
AND WHEREAS the mines in the Sydney
coalfield are faced with imminent closure
unless a substantial capital investment is
made for their rehabilitation and moderniza
tion and as a result of the aforementioned
factors and the substantial dependence of the
people of Sydney and the surrounding area
and of the economy of the Island of Cape
Breton on the coal mining operations in the
coalfield, a critical situation exists on the
Island which is of concern to Canada as a
whole ;
AND WHEREAS it is considered desirable and
the Governments of Canada and Nova Scotia
have agreed that a Crown corporation be
established to promote and assist the financing
and development of industry on the Island to
provide employment outside the coal produc
ing industry and broaden the base of the
economy of the Island, and to acquire the
interests of the major coal producer in the
Sydney coalfield and reorganize and operate
the mines with a view to the rationalization
of coal production therefrom and the progres
sive withdrawal of the corporation from such
production in accordance with a plan that
takes into account progress in providing
employment outside the coal producing
industry and in broadening the base of the
Island s economy;
Now, THEREFORE, Her Majesty, by and
with the advice and consent of the Senate
and House of Commons of Canada, enacts as
follows:
