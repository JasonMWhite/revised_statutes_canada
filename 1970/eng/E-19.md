enter with workmen, carts, carriages and
upon any land, and deposit thereon
earth, gravel, trees, bushes, logs, poles,

discontinued, may be transferred by the

property of, the owner of the land of which
it originally formed part ; and

maintaining or repairing of the public work,
to take down or remove any wall or fence of
an y owner or occupier of land or premises
adjoining the public work, or to construct any
back ditches or drains for carrying off water,
such wall or fence shall be replaced as soon as
the necessity which caused its taking down or
removal has ceased ; and after the same has
been so replaced, or when such drain or back
ditch is completed, the owner or occupier of
such land or premises shall maintain such
walls or fences, drains or back ditches, to the

such lot or parcel, and also the right-of-
thereto, if the lot or parcel is separated
from the public work, and may sell and
convey the same, or any part thereof, from
time to time, as he deems expedient ; but the
compulsory provisions of this Act do not

acquired by Her Majesty for the public work.
(2) The boundaries of such properties may
be permanently established by means of
proper stone or iron monuments planted by
the engineer or surveyor so employed by the
Minister.
(3) Such surveys, boundaries, plans and
descriptions have the same effect to all intents
and purposes as if the operations pertaining
thereto or connected therewith had been
performed and such boundaries had been
established and such monuments planted by
a land surveyor duly licensed and sworn in
and for the province in which the property is
situated.
(4) Such boundaries shall be held to be the
true and unalterable boundaries of such
property, if
  * (_a_) they are so established, and such
monuments of iron or stone so planted,
after due notice of the intention to establish
and plant the same has been given in
writing to the proprietors of the land
thereby affected,
(6) a proces-verbal or written description of
the boundaries is approved and signed in
the presence of two witnesses by such
engineer or surveyor on behalf of the
Minister and by the other person concerned,
or in case of the refusal of any proprietor
to approve or to sign the proces-verbal or
description, such refusal is recorded in the
proces-verbal or description, and
  * (_c_) such boundary marks or monuments are
planted in the presence of at least one
witness who shall sign the said proces-verbal
or description.
(5) It is not incumbent on the Minister or
those acting for him to have boundaries
established with the formalities mentioned in
this section, but they may be resorted to
whenever the Minister deems necessary. R.S.,
c. 106,s.7.
&. (1) In any case where Her Majesty has
contracted with any person, whether a
corporation or an individual, for the construc
tion or execution of any public work, or where
by direction of the Governor in Council, or of
the Minister within the scope of his powers,
any officer, employee or agent of Her Majesty
is charged with the construction or execution
of any public work, if in the opinion of the
Governor in Council it is necessary or
expedient that any material, wherever situat
ed, that is required to be excavated or removed
for the purposes of the work shall be excavated
or removed by blasting, or by the use of
explosives, the Governor in Council may
authorize the work to be performed in that
manner, notwithstanding that the blasting or
explosions may cause damage to or may
injuriously affect lands, buildings or property
or the prosecution of any industry or work
situated in the vicinity of the works or that
may be thereby affected.
(2) Any such contractor, officer, employee
or agent when so authorized by order in
council may proceed with the blasting and
use of explosives as by the order in council
authorized, using due care and such precau
tions and prudent means as the circumstances
of the case permit in order to avoid any
unnecessary damage ; and in any such case
the owner or any person interested in the
lands, buildings or other property that may
be damaged or injuriously affected by the
blasting or the explosions, and whether such
damage or injurious affection is necessarily
caused thereby or by negligence on the part
of the contractor, his officers or servants, or
any officer, employee or servant of Her
Majesty in the operation of blasting or in the
use of explosives, is entitled to receive
compensation therefor from Her Majesty.
(3) Where the construction or execution of
the public work is contracted for, then, unless
the contract otherwise provides, the amount
of compensation payable by Her Majesty is
chargeable to the contractor; and, if not paid
by him forthwith upon demand, may be
recovered from him by Her Majesty as money
paid to the contractor s use, or may be
deducted from any moneys in the hands of
Her Majesty belonging or in anywise payable
to the contractor.
(4) The provisions of this section have effect
and apply notwithstanding any action, suit
or proceeding now pending or hereafter to be
instituted in which it is sought to enjoin or
restrain the contractor, his servants or agents
or any officer, servant or agent of Her Majesty
from proceeding with the work by means of
blasting or the use of explosives or from
blasting or using explosives in a manner to
cause any damage or injury and notwith
standing any judgment, injunction or restrain
ing order that may have been heretofore
pronounced, entered or granted by any court
enjoining or restraining the contractor, his
servants or agents, or any officer, servant or
agent of Her Majesty from blasting or using
explosives, or from so doing in a manner to
cause any damage or injury or otherwise from
doing anything that has been authorized by
the Governor in Council pursuant to this
section, or that may be necessary to be done
for carrying into effect or executing any
power or authority hereunder conferred. R.S.,
c. 106,s.8.

always the rights of any other person to such
compensation money as against the person
receiving the same. R.S., c. 106, s. 25.

Canada, the facts warrant.
(2) The information shall be served in like
manner as other informations, and all pro
ceedings in respect thereof or subsequent
thereto shall be regulated by and shall
conform as nearly as may be to the procedure
in other cases instituted by information in
the Court. R.S., c. 106, s. 28.

**29.** Any person who is mentioned in any
such information, or who afterwards is made
or becomes a party thereto, may, by his
answer, exception or defence, raise any
question of fact or law incident to the
determination of his rights to such compensa

declare that, in addition to any damages
awarded, the claimant is entitled to have such
alteration or addition made, or such additional
work constructed, or portion of land aban

but no person to whom has been tendered a
sum equal to or greater than the amount to
which the Court finds him entitled shall be
allowed any interest on such compensation
money for any time subsequent to the date of
such tender.
(2) Where the Court is of opinion that the
delay in the final determination of any such
matter is attributable in whole or in part to
any person entitled to such compensation
money or any part thereof, or that such
person has not, upon demand made therefor,
furnished to the Minister within a reasonable
time a true statement of the particulars of his
claim required to be furnished as hereinbefore
provided, the Court may, for the whole or
any portion of the time for which he would
otherwise be entitled to interest, refuse to
allow him interest, or it may allow the same
at such rate less than five per cent per annum
