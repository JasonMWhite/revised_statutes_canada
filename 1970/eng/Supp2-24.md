manager or operator of an elevator or
other person authorized by the Board to
make advance payments on its behalf."

**4.** (1) Paragraph 4(1) (e) of the said Act
is repealed and the following substituted
therefor:

ization by the applicant stating that,
where the applicant delivers and sells
grain of any kind to the Board in a crop

sued in substitution or extension thereof,
there may be deducted from the initial
payment and paid to the Board for each
bushel of that grain, until the under
taking of the applicant has been dis
charged, an amount per bushel equal to
  * (_a_) the amount per bushel prescribed
per bushel that may be paid as an
advance payment in that crop year in
respect of grain of that kind, or
(6) the amount remaining after the
charges for freight and handling, and
any other charge or levy prescribed or

**5.** Section 5 of the said Act is repealed
and the following substituted therefor:
"5. (1) Before an advance payment is
made to a producer he shall execute an
undertaking in prescribed form in favour
of the Board to the effect that
  * (_a_) as soon as general acreage quotas
enable him to do so, he will, in addi
tion to any deliveries described in sub
section 11(2), deliver and sell grain to
the Board until the aggregate of the
deductions from the initial payments
for the grain under subsection 4(2) in
respect of those deliveries and sales of
grain to the Board is equal to the ad
vance payment made to him;
  * (_b_) upon default he will pay to the
Board the amount in default with in
terest at the appropriate prescribed
rate per annum on the amount in de
fault from the date of the making of
the advance payment; and
  * (_c_) if, pursuant to subsection (2), he
discharges his obligation to the Board
otherwise than in the circumstances set
out in subsection (3) or (4), he will
pay to the Board interest on any pay
ment made to the Board at the ap
propriate prescribed rate per annum
from the date of the making of the
advance payment.
(2) A recipient may at any time dis
charge his obligation to deliver grain to
the Board by payment to the Board.
(3) Where a recipient discharges his
obligation to deliver grain to the Board
by payment to the Board under sub
section (2), no interest is payable on
the first five hundred dollars so paid
by him prior to default.
(4) Where a recipient has, during a
crop year, delivered and sold to the
Board the maximum quantity of grain
of each kind that he was authorized to
deliver and sell to the Board under
general acreage quotas that applied to
him in that crop year and has not, at
the end of the crop year, discharged his
obligation to deliver grain to the Board,
no interest is payable on any payment
made by him under subsection (2) prior
to default."

**6.** Subsection 6(3) of the said Act is re
pealed and the following substituted there
for:
"(3) Where an application by two or
more joint producers specifies the share
of the advance payment to be paid to
each such producer, and subsequently the
undertaking is in default, a joint pro
ducer who pays to the Board an amount
that is in the same proportion to the
amount in default as his share of the
advance payment is to the total advance
payment, together with interest thereon
at the appropriate prescribed rate per
annum from the date of the making of
the advance payment, is, notwithstanding
anything in this Act, relieved of his
obligation to make any further payment
to the Board in respect of the default."

**7.** (1) Subsections 7(1) and (2) of the
"7. (1) Subject to this section, the
amount of an advance payment to a
producer in respect of the grain of any
kind deliverable under the permit book
specified in the application shall be the
quantity of threshed grain of that kind
(irrespective of its grade) that the ap
plicant has in storage otherwise than in
an elevator and undertakes to deliver to
the Board, less any undelivered grain of
that kind in respect of which a previous
advance payment was made, multiplied
by the advance payment rate per bushel
prescribed for that kind of grain.
(2) The quantity of grain of any kind
in respect of which an advance payment
may be made to a producer shall not
exceed the quantity that would be
deliverable under the applicant s current
permit book if deliveries were made un
der that permit book on the basis of the
number of bushels prescribed in respect of
that kind of grain for the purpose of
making advances under this Act multi
plied by the number of quota acres as
signed in the permit book to that kind of
grain minus the quantity of grain of that
kind delivered to the Board by the ap
plicant under general acreage quotas
prior to his application and during the
crop year in which the application is
made."
(2) Section 7 of the said Act is further
amended by adding thereto the following
subsections :
"(4) The Governor in Council shall
prescribe as the advance payment rate
per bushel for a kind of grain in a crop
year a rate that, in his opinion, approx
imates sixty-six and two-thirds per cent
of the initial payment that will be
payable in that crop year for the pre
scribed grade of that kind of grain.
(5) For the purposes of subsection (4) ,
the Governor in Council shall, imme-
diately prior to the commencement of
each crop year in respect of each kind
of grain,
  * (_a_) estimate the quantity of grain of
each grade to be delivered to the Board
in that crop year; and
(6) prescribe the grade that relates to
the largest quantity estimated pur
suant to paragraph (a)."
