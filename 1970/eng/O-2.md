## STATUTORY AND OTHER INSTRUMENTS

or Government of Canada or any judicial,
quasi-judicial or administrative body or Crown
corporation established by or pursuant to an
Act of the Parliament of Canada, shall be
promulgated in both official languages. 1968-

and proclamations that are required by or
under the authority of any Act of the
Parliament of Canada to be published in the
official gazette of Canada shall be made or
issued in both official languages and shall be
published accordingly in both official lan-
guages, except that where the authority by
which any such rule, order, regulation, by-law
proclamation is to be made or issued is of
the opinion that its making or issue is urgent
and that to make or issue it in both official
languages would occasion a delay prejudicial
to the public interest, the rule, order,
regulation, by-law or proclamation shall be
made or issued in the first instance in its
version in one of the official languages and
thereafter, within the time limited for the
transmission of copies thereof or its publica
tion as required by law, in its version in the
other, each such version to be effective from
the time the first is effective. 1968-69,c. 54,
s. 4.

**5.** (1) All final decisions, orders and judg
ments, including any reasons given therefor,
issued by any judicial or quasi-judicial body
established by or pursuant to an Act of the
Parliament of Canada shall be issued in both
official languages where the decision, order
or judgment determines a question of law of
general public interest or importance or where
the proceedings leading to its issue were
conducted in whole or in part in both official
languages.
(2) Where any final decision, order or
judgment issued by a body described in
subsection (1) is not required by that subsection
to be issued in both official languages, or
where a body described in that subsection by
which any final decision, order or judgment
including any reasons given therefor is to be
issued is of the opinion that to issue it in both
official languages would occasion a delay
prejudicial to the public interest or resulting
in injustice or hardship to any party to the
proceedings leading to its issue, the decision,
order or judgment including any reasons
given therefor shall be issued in the first
instance in its version in one of the official
languages and thereafter, within such time as
is reasonable in the circumstances, in its
version in the other, each such version to be
effective from the time the first is effective.
(3) Nothing in subsection (1) or (2) shall be
construed as prohibiting the oral rendition or
delivery, in one only of the official languages,
of any decision, order or judgment or any
reasons given therefor.
ings before a body described in subsection (1)
shall be made in both official languages but
where the body by which any such instrument
is to be made is satisfied that its making in
both official languages would occasion a delay
resulting in injustice or hardship to any
person or class of persons, the instrument
shall be made in the first instance in its
version in one of the official languages and
thereafter as soon as possible in its version in
the other, each such version to be effective
from the time the first is effective. 1968-69, c.

operation of any law of Canada relating to
the conviction of a person for an offence
consisting of a contravention of a rule, order,
regulation, by-law or proclamation that at
the time of the alleged contravention was not
published in the official gazette of Canada in
both official languages, no instrument
described in section 4 or 5 is invalid by reason
only that it was not made or issued in
compliance with those sections, unless in the
case of any instrument described in section 4
it is established by the person asserting its
invalidity that the non-compliance was due
to bad faith on the part of the authority by
which the instrument was made or issued.
1968-69, c. 54, s. 6.

**7.** Where, by or under the authority of the
Parliament or Government of Canada or any
judicial, quasi-judicial or administrative body
or Crown corporation established by or
pursuant to an Act of the Parliament of
Canada, any notice, advertisement or other
matter is to be printed in a publication for
the information primarily of members of the
public resident in the National Capital Region
or a federal bilingual district established
under this Act, the matter shall, wherever
possible in publications in general circulation
within that Region or district, be printed in
one of the official languages in at least one
such publication appearing wholly or mainly
in that language and in the other official
language in at least one such publication
appearing wholly or mainly in that other
language, and shall be given as nearly as
reasonably may be equal prominence in each
such publication. 1968-69, c. 54, s. 7.

in the official languages are equally
authentic.
(2) In applying subsection (1) to the
construction of an enactment,
  * (_a_) where it is alleged or appears that the
two versions of the enactment differ in their
meaning, regard shall be had to both its
versions so that, subject to paragraph (c),
the like effect is given to the enactment in
every part of Canada in which the enact
ment is intended to apply, unless a contrary
intent is explicitly or implicitly evident ;
(6) subject to paragraph (c), where in the
enactment there is a reference to a concept,
matter or thing the reference shall, in its
expression in each version of the enactment,
be construed as a reference to the concept,
matter or thing to which in its expression
in both versions of the enactment the
reference is apt ;
  * (_c_) where a concept, matter or thing in its
expression in one version of the enactment
is incompatible with the legal system or
institutions of a part of Canada in which
the enactment is intended to apply but in
its expression in the other version of the
enactment is compatible therewith, a refer
ence in the enactment to the concept,
matter or thing shall, as the enactment
applies to that part of Canada, be construed
as a reference to the concept, matter or
thing in its expression in that version of the
enactment that is compatible therewith;
and
  * (_d_) if the two versions of the enactment
differ in a manner not coming within
paragraph (c), preference shall be given to
the version thereof that, according to the
true spirit, intent and meaning of the
enactment, best ensures the attainment of
its objects. 1968-69, c. 54, s. 8.
