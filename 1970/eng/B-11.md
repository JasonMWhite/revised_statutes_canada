persons to receive programs, subject only to
generally applicable statutes and regula
tions, is unquestioned;

ming provided by each broadcaster should
be of high standard, using predominantly
Canadian creative and other resources ;

ing service in English and French as public

mation and entertainment, and

national unity and provide for a continu
ing expression of Canadian identity ;

objectives of the national broadcasting
service and the interests of the private
element of the Canadian broadcasting
system, it shall be resolved in the public
interest but paramount consideration shall
be given to the objectives of the national
broadcasting service ;
(?) facilities should be provided within the
Canadian broadcasting system for educa
tional broadcasting; and
0) the regulation and supervision of the
Canadian broadcasting system should be
flexible and readily adaptable to scientific
and technical advances ;
and that the objectives of the broadcasting
policy for Canada enunciated in this section
best be achieved by providing for the
and supervision of the Canadian
broadcasting system by a single independent
