## CHAPTER C- 14
An Act to give effect to a Convention for the
Unification of Certain Rules Relating to
International Carriage by Air
WHEREAS a Convention for the Unification
of Certain Rules Relating to International
Carriage by Air was signed at Warsaw on the
12th day of October 1929, and it is expedient
that legislative provision be made for giving
effect thereto and for performing the obliga
tions of Canada in respect thereof, in the
event that Canada accedes to the said
Convention or the Additional Protocol ; and
WHEREAS it is also expedient to make
provision for applying the rules contained in
the said Convention, subject to exceptions,
adaptations and modifications, to carriage by
air which is not international carriage within
the meaning of the Convention : Therefore
His Majesty, by and with the advice and
consent of the Senate and House of Commons
of Canada, enacts as follows:

**1.** This Act may be cited as the Carriage
by Air Act. R.S., c. 45, s. 1.

**2.** (1) On and after the 1st day of July
1947, the provisions of the Convention as set
out in Schedule I, so far as they relate to the
rights and liabilities of carriers, passengers,
consignors, consignees and other persons and
subject to the provisions of this section, have
the force of law in Canada in relation to any
carriage by air to which the Convention
applies, irrespective of the nationality of the
aircraft performing that carriage.
(2) Subject to this section, the provisions of
thg Convention set out in Schedule I, as
by the Protocol set out in Schedule
in so far as they relate to the rights and
liabilities of carriers, passengers, consign
ors, consignees and other persons, have the
force of law in Canada in relation to any
carriage by air to which the Convention as so
amended applies, irrespective of the nation
ality of the aircraft performing that carriage.
(3) The Governor in Council may from
time to time by proclamation published in
the Canada Gazette certify who are the High
Contracting Parties to the Convention, in
respect of what territories they are respectively
parties, to what extent they have availed
themselves of the Additional Protocol to the
Convention and who are the parties to the
Protocol set out in Schedule III, and any such
proclamation is, except in so far as it has been
superseded by a subsequent proclamation,
conclusive evidence of the matters so certified.
(4) Any reference in Schedule I to the
territory of any High Contracting Party to
the Convention shall be construed as a
reference to the territories subject to his
sovereignty, suzerainty, mandate or authority,
in respect of which he is a party.
(5) Any liability imposed by Article 17 of
Schedule I on a carrier in respect of the death
of a passenger shall be in substitution for any
liability of the carrier in respect of the death
of that passenger under any law in force in
Canada, and the provisions set out in Schedule
II shall have effect with respect to the persons
by and for whose benefit the liability so
imposed is enforceable and with respect to
the manner in which it may be enforced.
(6) Any sum in francs mentioned in Article
22 of Schedule I shall, for the purposes of any
action against a carrier, be converted into
Canadian dollars at the rate of exchange
prevailing on the date on which the amount
of any damage to be paid by the carrier is
ascertained by the court. R.S., c. 45, s. 2; 1963,
c. 33, s. 1.

**3.** Every High Contracting Party to the
Convention who has not availed himself of
the provisions of the Additional Protocol
thereto shall, for the purposes of any action
brought in a court in Canada in accordance
the provisions of Article 28 of Schedule
I to enforce a claim in respect of carriage
undertaken by him, be deemed to have
submitted to the jurisdiction of that court,
and accordingly rules of court may provide
for the manner in which any such action is to
be commenced and carried on ; but nothing
in this section shall authorize the issue of
execution against the property of any High
Contracting Party. R.S., c. 45, s. 3.

**4.** The Governor in Council may make
orders or regulations applying the provisions
of Schedule I and any provision of section 2
to such carriage by air, not being international
carriage by air as defined in Schedule I, as
may be specified in the order or regulation,
subject however to such exceptions, adapta
tions and modifications, if any, as may be so
specified. R.S., c. 45, s. 4.

**5.** For the avoidance of doubt, references
to agents in Schedule I include references to
servants. R.S., c. 45, s. 5.

**6.** In this Act except subsections 2(1) to (4),
a reference to Schedule I or to any article or
provision thereof shall,
  * (_a_) in relation to any carriage by air to
which the Convention as amended by the
Protocol set out in Schedule III applies, or
(6) in relation to the application of the
provisions of Schedule I and any provision
of section 2 to any carriage by air not being
international carriage by air as defined in
Schedule I,
be read as though for the provisions of the
Convention set out in Schedule I there were
substituted the provisions of the Convention
as amended by the Protocol set out in
Schedule III, and a reference to "international
carriage by air as defined in Schedule I" shall
be read as a reference to international carriage
as defined in Schedule I or in the Convention
as amended by the Protocol set out in
Schedule III. 1963, c. 33, s. 2.

Plenipotentiaries, who, being thereto duly authorized, have
concluded and signed the following convention:

## CHAPTER I

## SCOPE DEFINITIONS
Article 1
(1) This Convention applies to all international carriage of
persons, baggage or cargo performed by aircraft for reward. It
applies equally to gratuitous carriage by aircraft performed by
an air transport undertaking.
(2) For the purposes of this Convention the expression
"international carnage" means any carriage in which, according to
the agreement between the parties, the place of departure and the
place of destination, whether or not there be a break in the carriage
or a transhipment, are situated either within the territories of two
High Contracting Parties, or within the territory of a single High
Contracting Party, if there is an agreed stopping place within a
territory subject to the sovereignty, suzerainty, mandate or authority
of another Power, even though that Power is not a party to this
Convention. A carriage without such an agreed stopping place
between territories subject to the sovereignty, suzerainty, mandate or
authority of the same High Contracting Party is not deemed to be
international for the purposes of this Convention.
(3) A carriage to be performed by several successive air carriers is
deemed, for the purposes of this Convention, to be one undivided
carriage, if it has been regarded by the parties as a single operation,
whether it had been agreed upon under the form of a single contract
or of a series of contracts, and it does not lose its international
character merely because one contract or a series of contracts is to
performed entirely within a territory subject to the sovereignty,
mandate or authority of the same High Contracting
[Note: The paragraphs of the Convention shown in italics
deleted and replaced (except in the case of paragraph 2 of
Article 20) by the Protocol set out in Schedule III, infra.]
Article 2
(1) This Convention applies to carriage performed by the
State or by legally constituted public bodies provided it falls
within the conditions laid down in Article 1.
(2) This Convention does not apply to carriage performed under
the terms of any international postal Convention.

ticket having been delivered he shall not be entitled to avail himself
of those provisions of this Convention which exclude or limit his
liability.

particulars set out at (d), (f) and (h) above, the carrier shall not be
entitled to avail himself of those provisions of the Convention which

the contract, of the receipt of the cargo and of the conditions of
carriage.
(2) The statements in the air waybill relating to the weight,
dimensions and packing of the cargo, as well as those relating
to the number of packages, are prima facie evidence of the facts
stated; those relating to the quantity, volume and condition of
the cargo do not constitute evidence against the carrier except
so far as they both have been, and are stated in the air waybill
to have been, checked by him in the presence of the consignor,
or relate to the apparent condition of the cargo.
Article 12
(1) Subject to his liability to carry out all his obligations
under the contract of carriage, the consignor has the right to
dispose of the cargo by withdrawing it at the aerodrome of

the place of destination or in the course of the journey to a
other than the consignee named in the air waybill, or by

without prejudice to his right of recovery from the consignor,
for any damage which may be caused thereby to any person
who is lawfully in possession of that part of the air waybill.
(4) The right conferred on the consignor ceases at the moment
when that of the consignee begins in accordance with Article 13.
Nevertheless, if the consignee declines to accept the waybill or
the cargo, or if he cannot be communicated with, the consignor
resumes his right of disposition.
Article 13

the air waybill and to deliver the cargo to him, on payment of
the charges due and on complying with the conditions of
carriage set out in the air waybill.
(2) Unless it is otherwise agreed, it is the duty of the carrier
to give notice to the consignee as soon as the cargo arrives.
(3) If the carrier admits the loss of the cargo, or if the cargo
has not arrived at the expiration of seven days after the date
on which it ought to have arrived, the consignee is entitled to
put into force against the carrier the rights which flow from the
contract of carriage.
Article 14
The consignor and the consignee can respectively enforce all
the rights given them by Articles 12 and 13, each in his own
name, whether he is acting in his own interest or in the interest
of another, provided that he carries out the obligations imposed
by the contract.
Article 15

Article 16
(1) The consignor must furnish such information and attach
to the air waybill such documents as are necessary to meet the
formalities of customs, octroi or police before the cargo can be
delivered to the consignee. The consignor is liable to the carrier
for any damage occasioned by the absence, insufficiency or
irregularity of any such information or documents, unless the
damage is due to the fault of the carrier or his agents.
(2) The carrier is under no obligation to enquire into the
correctness or sufficiency of such information or documents.

## CHAPTER III

## LIABILITY OF THE CARRIER
Article 17
The carrier is liable for damage sustained in the event of the
or wounding of a passenger or any other bodily injury
by a passenger, if the accident which caused the damage
sustained took place on board the aircraft or in the course of
any of the operations of embarking or disembarking.
Article 18
(1) The carrier is liable for damage sustained in the event of
the destruction or loss of, or of damage to, any registered
baggage or any cargo, if the occurrence which caused the damage
so sustained took place during the carriage by air.
(2) The carriage by air within the meaning of the preceding
paragraph comprises the period during which the baggage or
cargo is in charge of the carrier, whether in an aerodrome or on
board an aircraft, or, in the case of a landing outside an
aerodrome, in any place whatsoever.
(3) The period of the carriage by air does not extend to any
carriage by land, by sea or by river performed outside an
aerodrome. If, however, such a carriage takes place in the
performance of a contract for carriage by air, for the purpose of
loading, delivery or transhipment, any damage is presumed,
subject to proof to the contrary, to have been the result of an
event which took place during the carriage by air.
Article 19
The carrier is liable for damage occasioned by delay in the
carriage by air of passengers, baggage or cargo.
Article 20
(1) The carrier is not liable if he proves that he and his agents
have taken all necessary measures to avoid the damage or that
it was impossible for him or them to take such measures.
(2) In the carriage of cargo and baggage the carrier is not liable
if he proves that the damage was occasioned by negligent pilotage
or negligence in the handling of the aircraft or in navigation and
that, in all other respects, he and his agents have taken all necessary
measures to avoid the damage.
Article 21
If the carrier proves that the damage was caused by or
contributed to by the negligence of the injured person the Court
may, in accordance with the provisions of its own law, exonerate
the carrier wholly or partly from his liability.
Article 22
(1) In the carriage of passengers the liability of the carrier for
each passenger is limited to the sum of 125,000 francs. Where, in
accordance with the law of the Court seized of the case, damages
may be awarded in the form of periodical payments, the equivalent
capital value of the said payments shall not exceed 125,000 francs.
Nevertheless, by special contract, the carrier and the passenger may
agree to a higher limit of liability.
(2) In the carriage of registered baggage and of cargo, the liability
of the carrier is limited to a sum of 250 francs per kilogram, unless
the consignor has made, at the time when the package was handed
over to the carrier, a special declaration of the value at delivery and
has paid a supplementary sum if the case so requires. In that case
the carrier will be liable to pay a sum not exceeding the declared
unless he proves that that sum is greater than the actual value
to the consignor at delivery.
(3) As regards objects of which the passenger takes charge himself
the liability of the carrier is limited to 5,000 francs per passenger.
(4) The sums mentioned above shall be deemed to refer to the
French franc consisting of 65 j milligrams gold of millesimal fineness

**900.** These sums may be converted into any national currency in
round figures.
Article 23
Any provision tending to relieve the carrier of liability or to
fix a lower limit than that which is laid down in this Convention
shall be null and void, but the nullity of any such provision
does not involve the nullity of the whole contract, which shall
remain subject to the provisions of this Convention.
[Note : This provision was renumbered as paragraph (1) and
another provision added as paragraph (2) by Article XII of the
Protocol set out in Schedule III, infra.}
Article 24
(1) In the cases covered by Articles 18 and 19 any action for
damages, however founded, can only be brought subject to the
conditions and limits set out in this Convention.
(2) In the cases covered by Article 17 the provisions of the
preceding paragraph also apply, without prejudice to the
questions as to who are persons who have the right to bring suit
and what are their respective rights.
Article 25
(1) The carrier shall not be entitled to avail himself of the
provisions of this Convention which exclude or limit his liability, if
the damage is caused by his wilful misconduct or by such default on
his part as, in accordance with the law of the Court seized of the
case, is considered to be equivalent to wilful misconduct.
(2) Similarly the carrier shall not be entitled to avail himself of
the said provisions, if the damage is caused as aforesaid by any
agent of the carrier acting within the scope of his employment.
[Note : A new article numbered as Article 25A was added by
Article XIV of the Protocol set out in Schedule III, infra.]
Article 26
(1) Receipt by the person entitled to delivery of baggage or
cargo without complaint is prima facie evidence that the same
has been delivered in good condition and in accordance with
the document of carriage.
(2) In the case of damage, the person entitled to delivery must
complain to the carrier forthwith after the discovery of the damage,
and, at the latest, within three days from the date of receipt in the
case of baggage and seven days from the date of receipt in the case
of cargo. In the case of delay the complaint must be made at the
latest within fourteen days from the date on which the baggage or
cargo has been placed at his disposal.
(3) Every complaint must be made in writing upon the
document of carriage or by separate notice in writing despatched
within the times aforesaid.
(4) Failing complaint within the times aforesaid, no action
lie against the carrier, save in the case of fraud on his part.
Article 27
In the case of the death of the person liable, an action for
lies in accordance with the terms of this Convention
against those legally representing his estate.
Article 28
(1) An action for damages must be brought, at the option of
the plaintiff, in the territory of one of the High Contracting
Parties, either before the Court having jurisdiction where the
carrier is ordinarily resident, or has his principal place of
business, or has an establishment by which the contract has been
made or before the Court having jurisdiction at the place of
destination.
(2) Questions of procedure shall be governed by the law of the
Court seized of the case.
Article 29
(1) The right to damages shall be extinguished if an action is
not brought within two years, reckoned from the date of arrival
at the destination, or from the date on which the aircraft ought
to have arrived, or from the date on which the carriage stopped.
(2) The method of calculating the period of limitation shall
be determined by the law of the Court seized of the case.
Article 30
(1) In the case of carriage to be performed by various successive
carriers and falling within the definition set out in the third
paragraph of Article 1, each carrier who accepts passengers,
baggage or cargo is subjected to the rules set out in this
Convention, and is deemed to be one of the contracting parties
to the contract of carriage in so far as the contract deals with
that part of the carriage which is performed under his supervision.
(2) In the case of carriage of this nature, the passenger or his
representative can take action only against the carrier who
performed the carriage during which the accident or the delay
occurred, save in the case where, by express agreement, the first
carrier has assumed liability for the whole journey.
(3) As regards baggage or cargo, the passenger or consignor
will have a right of action against the first carrier, and the
passenger or consignee who is entitled to delivery will have a
right of action against the last carrier, and further, each may
take action against the carrier who performed the carriage
during which the destruction, loss, damage or delay took place.
These carriers will be jointly and severally liable to the passenger
or to the consignor or consignee.

## CHAPTER IV

## PROVISIONS RELATING TO COMBINED CARRIAGE
Article 31
(1) In the case of combined carriage performed partly by air
and partly by any other mode of carriage, the provisions of this
Convention apply only to the carriage by air, provided that the
carriage by air falls within the terms of Article 1.
(2) Nothing in this Convention shall prevent the parties in
case of combined carriage from inserting in the document of
carriage conditions relating to other modes of carriage,
that the provisions of this Convention are observed as
the carriage by air.

## CHAPTER V

## GENERAL AND FINAL PROVISIONS
Article 32
Any clause contained in the contract and all special agreements
entered into before the damage occurred by which the parties
purport to infringe the rules laid down by this Convention,
whether by deciding the law to be applied, or by altering the

the carriage of cargo arbitration clauses are allowed, subject to
this Convention, if the arbitration is to take place within one of
the jurisdictions referred to in the first paragraph of Article 28.
Article 33
Nothing contained in this Convention shall prevent the carrier
either from refusing to enter into any contract of carriage, or
from making regulations which do not conflict with the
provisions of this Convention.
Article 34
This Convention does not apply to international carriage by air
performed by way of experimental trial by air navigation undertakings
with the view to the establishment of a regular line of air navigation,
nor does it apply to carriage performed in extraordinary circumstances
outside the normal scope of an air carriers business.
Article 35
The expression "days" when used in this Convention means
current days not working days.

ratification shall be deposited in the archives of the Ministry
for Foreign Affairs of Poland, which will notify the deposit to
the Government of each of the High Contracting Parties.

Contracting Party who deposits his instrument of ratification
on the ninetieth day after the deposit.

protectorates, territories under mandate or any other territory
subject to his sovereignty or to his authority or any territory
under his suzerainty which has been thus excluded by his
original declaration.

**2.** An action to enforce the liability may be brought by any

in another province or outside Canada, in respect of the death
of the passenger in question; and, without restricting the

## THE HAGUE
28 September 1955
Governments Undersigned
Considering that it is desirable to amend the Convention for
the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to International
Carriage by Air signed at Warsaw on 12 October 1929,
Have Agreed as follows :

## CHAPTER I

## AMENDMENTS TO THE CONVENTION
Article I
In Article 1 of the Convention
  * (_a_) paragraph (2) shall be deleted and replaced by the
following :
"(2) For the purposes of this Convention, the expression
international carriage means any carriage in which, according
to the agreement between the parties, the place of departure
and the place of destination, whether or not there be a break
in the carriage or a transhipment, are situated either within
the territories of two High Contracting Parties or within the
territory of a single High Contracting Party if there is an
agreed stopping place within the territory of another State,
even if that State is not a High Contracting Party. Carriage
between two points within the territory of a single High
Contracting Party without an agreed stopping place within
the territory of another State is not international carriage for
the purposes of this Convention."
(6) paragraph (3) shall be deleted and replaced by the
following :
"(3) Carriage to be performed by several successive air carriers
is deemed, for the purposes of this Convention, to be one
undivided carriage if it has been regarded by the parties as a
single operation, whether it had been agreed upon under the
form of a single contract or of a series of contracts, and it does
not lose its international character merely because one contract
or a series of contracts is to be performed entirely within the
territory of the same State."
Article II
In Article 2 of the Convention
paragraph (2) shall be deleted and replaced by the following :
"(2) This Convention shall not apply to carriage of mail and
postal packages."
Article III
In Article 3 of the Convention
  * (_a_) paragraph (1) shall be deleted and replaced by the

delivered containing :
  * (_a_) an indication of the places of departure and destination ;
  * (_b_) if the places of departure and destination are within the
territory of a single High Contracting Party, one or more
agreed stopping places being within the territory of another
State, an indication of at least one such stopping place;
  * (_c_) a notice to the effect that, if the passenger s journey
involves an ultimate destination or stop in a country other
than the country of departure, the Warsaw Convention may
be applicable and that the Convention governs and in most
cases limits the liability of carriers for death or personal
injury and in respect of loss of or damage to baggage."
  * (_b_) paragraph (2) shall be deleted and replaced by the
following :
"(2) The passenger ticket shall constitute prima facie evidence
of the conclusion and conditions of the contract of carriage.
The absence, irregularity or loss of the passenger ticket does
not affect the existence or the validity of the contract of
carriage which shall, none the less, be subject to the rules of
this Convention. Nevertheless, if, with the consent of the
carrier, the passenger embarks without a passenger ticket
having been delivered, or if the ticket does not include the
notice required by paragraph (1) (c) of this Article, the carrier
shall not be entitled to avail himself of the provisions of
Article 22."

provisions of Article 3, paragraph (1), shall contain:
  * (_a_) an indication of the places of departure and destination ;
(6) if the places of departure and destination are within the
territory of a single High Contracting Party, one or more
agreed stopping places being within the territory of another

damage to baggage."
  * (_b_) paragraph (4) shall be deleted and replaced by the
following :
"(2) The baggage check shall constitute prima facie evidence
of the registration of the baggage and of the conditions of the
contract of carriage. The absence, irregularity or loss of the
baggage check does not affect the existence or the validity of
the contract of carriage which shall, none the less, be subject
to the rules of this Convention. Nevertheless, if the carrier
takes charge of the baggage without a baggage check having
been delivered or if the baggage check (unless combined with
or incorporated in the passenger ticket which complies with
the provisions of Article 3, paragraph (1) (c)) does not include
the notice required by paragraph (1) (c) of this Article, he
shall not be entitled to avail himself of the provisions of
Article 22, paragraph (2)."

board the aircraft.

damage to cargo."

"If, with the consent of the carrier, cargo is loaded on board
the aircraft without an air waybill having been made out, or

avail himself of the provisions of Article 22, paragraph (2)."

carrier is liable, by reason of the irregularity, incorrectness or
incompleteness of the particulars and statements furnished by
the consignor."
Article IX
To Article 15 of the Convention

negotiable air waybill."

each passenger is limited to the sum of two hundred and fifty
thousand francs. Where, in accordance with the law of the court
seised of the case, damages may be awarded in the form of
payments, the equivalent capital value of the said
shall not exceed two hundred and fifty thousand
Nevertheless, by special contract, the carrier and the
may agree to a higher limit of liability.
(2) (a) In the carriage of registered baggage and of cargo, the
liability of the carrier is limited to a sum of two hundred and
fifty francs per kilogramme, unless the passenger or consignor
has made, at the time when the package was handed over to the
carrier, a special declaration of interest in delivery at destination
and has paid a supplementary sum if the case so requires. In
that case the carrier will be liable to pay a sum not exceeding
the declared sum, unless he proves that that sum is greater than
the passenger s or consignor s actual interest in delivery at
destination.
(6) In the case of loss, damage or delay of part of registered
baggage or cargo, or of any object contained therein, the
weight to be taken into consideration in determining the
amount to which the carrier s liability is limited shall be only
the total weight of the package or packages concerned.
Nevertheless, when the loss, damage or delay of a part of the
registered baggage or cargo, or of an object contained therein,
affects the value of other packages covered by the same
baggage check or the same air waybill, the total weight of
such package or packages shall also be taken into consideration
in determining the limit of liability.
(3) As regards objects of which the passenger takes charge
himself the liability of the carrier is limited to five thousand
francs per passenger.
(4) The limits prescribed in this article shall not prevent the
court from awarding, in accordance with its own law, in addition,
the whole or part of the court costs and of the other expenses of
the litigation incurred by the plaintiff. The foregoing provision
shall not apply if the amount of the damages awarded, excluding
court costs and other expenses of the litigation, does not exceed
the sum which the carrier has offered in writing to the plaintiff
within a period of six months from the date of the occurrence
causing the damage, or before the commencement of the action,
if that is later.
(5) The sums mentioned in francs in this Article shall be
deemed to refer to a currency unit consisting of sixty-five and a
half milligrammes of gold of millesimal fineness nine hundred.
These sums may be converted into national currencies in round
figures. Conversion of the sums into national currencies other
than gold shall, in case of judicial proceedings, be made
according to the gold value of such currencies at the date of the
judgment."

In Article 23 of the Convention, the existing provision shall
be renumbered as paragraph 1 and another paragraph shall be

quality or vice of the cargo carried."
Article XIII
In Article 25 of the Convention
paragraphs (1) and (2) shall be deleted and replaced by the
following :
"The limits of liability specified in Article 22 shall not apply
if it is proved that the damage resulted from an act or
omission of the carrier, his servants or agents, done with intent
to cause damage or recklessly and with knowledge that
damage would probably result; provided that, in the case of
such act or omission of a servant or agent, it is also proved
that he was acting within the scope of his employment."
Article XIV
After Article 25 of the Convention, the following article shall
be inserted :

invoke under Article 22.
(2) The aggregate of the amounts recoverable from the carrier,
his servants and agents, in that case, shall not exceed the said
limits.
(3) The provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) of this article

paragraph (2) shall be deleted and replaced by the following :

days from the date on which the baggage or cargo have been
placed at his disposal."
