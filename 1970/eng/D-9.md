# CHAPTER D-9
Act to encourage the construction of dry
docks

**1.** This Act may be cited as the Dry Docks
Subsidies Act. R.S., c. 91, s. 1.

**2.** In this Act
"dry dock" and "dock" include floating dry
docks;
"Minister" means the Minister of Public
Works. R.S., c. 91, s. 2.

**3.** (1) The Governor in Council may, as an
aid to the construction of any dry dock,
authorize the payment out of any unappro
priated money forming part of the Con
solidated Revenue Fund of a subsidy, in
accordance with this Act, to any incorporated
company, approved by the Governor in
Council as having the ability to perform the
work, that enters into an agreement with Her
Majesty to construct a dry dock under this
Act, with all necessary equipment, machinery
and plant, for the reception and repairing of
vessels.
(2) No such aid shall be granted unless the
Governor in Council is satisfied, upon a report
of the Minister, based upon a report of the
chief engineer of the Department of Public
Works, and such other evidence as he deems
necessary, that such dry dock is needed in the
public interest, and is, as proposed, of
sufficient capacity to meet the public require
ments where such dry dock is to be located.
R.S., c. 91, s. 3.

**4.** (1) For the purpose of constructing a
dry dock under this Act, the company entering
into the agreement contemplated by section
3 may utilize, or acquire for the purpose of
utilizing, the works and property of any
existing dry dock company whose dock has
been constructed under chapter 17 of the
Statutes of Canada, 1882, chapter 9 of the
Statutes of Canada, 1899, chapter 116 of the
Revised Statutes of Canada, 1906, or chapter
24 of the Statutes of Canada, 1908 ; and the
value of such works and property at the time
when the agreement is entered into, so far as
such works and property may be useful in the
construction of a dry dock of greater dimen
sions or capacity under this Act, shall be
deemed to be for the purposes of subsidy
calculation a part of the cost of the dry dock
constructed under this Act.
(2) The aggregate amount of all subsidies
paid by the Governor in Council, in respect
of the dock so utilized, under any of the
chapters mentioned in subsection (1), before
the agreement to construct under this Act is
entered into, shall be deducted from the
subsidy payable under this Act, and such
deduction shall be made in equal annual
portions during the period in respect of which
the subsidy is payable under this Act; and
the remaining payments, if any, of the subsidy
called for by the agreement entered into
under any of the said chapters shall not be
made.
(3) For the purposes of this section the
value of the works and property of any
existing dry dock company shall be estimated
by the Minister, based upon a report of the
chief engineer of the Department of Public
Works ; and the Governor in Council, having
regard to such estimate, shall determine the
value of such works and property, and such
amount shall be so determined before the said
agreement is entered into. R.S., c. 91, s. 4.

**5.** Any company that seeks to enter into
an agreement with Her Majesty to construct
a dry dock under this Act shall, as part of its
for the site in cash and does not obtain or has
not obtained a site by way of bonus or gift,
and such estimates of cost shall be in such
detail as will enable the chief engineer of the
Department of Public Works to verify them
for the purposes of the report required to be
made by him under section 8. R.S., c. 91, s. 5.

**6.** Where the company, after it has entered
into an agreement with Her Majesty to
construct a dry dock under this Act, is unable
to agree with the owner of any land or
immovable property, or interest therein as to
the purchase, acquisition or transfer thereof,
or the price to be paid therefor, and the land
or immovable property or interest is deemed
by the company necessary for a site for such
dry dock, the company may, upon the
approval of the Governor in Council, acquire
such land or immovable property or interest
without the consent of the owner, and has in
such cases, for all purposes of the taking,
acquiring, ascertaining the value of and
making compensation for the said land or
immovable property or interest, all the powers
of a railway company under the Railway Act
relative to the taking and using of land, and
the compensation and damages therefor, and
the Railway Act applies, mutatis mutandis and
in so far as applicable, to the taking and
acquiring of, and the ascertaining and
payment of the compensation and damages
for, such land, immovable property or interest
by the company. R.S., c. 91, s. 6.

**7.** Dry docks constructed under this Act
shall, for the purposes of this Act, be divided
into three classes, as follows :
  * (_a_) dry docks of the first class for naval and
general purposes costing, for the purposes
of the subsidy calculation, not more than
five million five hundred thousand dollars
in the case of dry docks specified in
subparagraph (i), and not more than four
million dollars in the case of dry docks
specified in subparagraph (ii), being
  * (_i_) dry docks, other than floating dry
docks, of dimensions when completed of
entrance, one hundred and twenty-five
feet , depth of water over sill at high water
ordinary spring tides, thirty-eight feet,
and
  * (_ii_) floating dry docks of a lifting capacity
of at least twenty-five thousand tons, in
which vessels can be received and repaired
with ease and safety,
but any such dry dock shall not for the
purposes of this Act be deemed to be a dry
dock of the first class unless there can be
received and repaired therein with ease and
safety the largest ships or vessels of the
British Navy existing at the time at which
the contract is entered into ;
(6) dry docks of the second class, costing
for the purposes of subsidy calculation not
more than two and one-half million dollars,
being
  * (_i_) dry docks, other than floating dry
docks, of dimensions when completed of
not less than the principal dimensions
next hereinafter mentioned, that is to
say, clear length on bottom from caisson
groove or hollowquoin to head, six
hundred and fifty feet, clear width of
entrance, eighty-five feet, depth of water
over the sill at high water ordinary spring
tides, thirty feet if constructed on tidal
waters and twenty-five feet over the sill
at ordinary low water if constructed on
non-tidal waters, and
  * (_ii_) floating dry docks of a lifting capacity
of at least fifteen thousand tons, and in
which vessels can be received and repaired
with ease and safety ;
  * (_c_) dry docks of the third class, costing for
the purposes of subsidy calculation not
more than one and one-half million dollars,
being
  * (_i_) dry docks, other than floating dry
docks, of dimensions when completed of
not less than the principal dimensions
next hereinafter mentioned, that is to
say, clear length on bottom from caisson
groove or hollowquoin to head, four
hundred feet, clear width of entrance,
sixty-five feet, depth of water over the
sill at high water ordinary spring tides,
twenty-two feet if constructed on tidal
waters and eighteen feet over the sill at
ordinary low water if constructed on non-
tidal waters, and
  * (_ii_) floating dry docks of a lifting capacity
of at least three thousand five hundred

and repaired with ease and safety. R.S.,
c. 91,s.7.
g. The cost on which the subsidy shall be
calculated shall be fixed and determined by
the Governor in Council, upon the recom
mendation of the Minister, based upon a

of Public Works, accompanied by plans and
specifications of the proposed works, and such
cost shall include the cost of all necessary
equipment, machinery and plant, and any
sum bona fide expended or to be expended by
the company in the purchase of a site for the
dry dock, but shall not include the value of
any site received or to be received by the
company by way of bonus or gift ; and the
amount of the subsidy shall be so fixed and
determined before the agreement for payment
of the subsidy is entered into. R.S., c. 91, s. 8.

**9.** (1) The subsidy in respect of dry docks
of the first class that have been constructed
under this Act shall be a sum not exceeding
four and one-half per cent per annum of the

unsettled liens, encumbrances or claims upon
or in respect of such dock, but thereafter the
Minister may permit the issue of bonds,
debentures, or other securities, and any
subsidy mentioned by this section may, with
the approval of the Minister, be assigned to a
trustee for the holder of such bonds, deben

such trustee, but, until the dock has been
completed to the satisfaction of the Minister,
the total amount of the bonds, debentures, or
