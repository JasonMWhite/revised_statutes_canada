## INTERPRETATION

**2.** In this Act
"Board" means the National Parole
Board;
"Commissioner" means the Commissioner
of the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police;
"Minister" means the Solicitor General
of Canada;
"pardon" means a pardon granted by the
Governor in Council under subsection
4(5);
"period of probation" means a period

tions prescribed in a probation order,
which period shall be deemed to have
terminated at the time the recogni-
zance or the probation order, as the
case may be, ceased to be in force.

## APPLICATION FOR PARDON

**3.** A person who has been convicted of
an offence under an Act of the Parlia
ment of Canada or a regulation made
thereunder may make application for a
pardon in respect of that offence.

## PROCEDURE

**4.** (1) An application for a pardon shall
be made to the Minister, who shall refer
it to the Board.
(2) The Board shall cause proper in
quiries to be made in order to ascertain
the behaviour of the applicant since the
date of his conviction, but such inquiries
shall not be made
  * (_a_) where the applicant was convicted
of an offence punishable on summary
conviction in proceedings under Part
XXIV of the Criminal Code, until, in
the case of the imposition on the appli
cant of
  * (_i_) a sentence of imprisonment,
  * (_ii_) a period of probation, or
  * (_iii_) a fine,
two years have elapsed since the termi
nation of the sentence of imprisonment,
the termination of the period of proba
tion or the payment of the fine, as the
case may be, or in the case of the im
position on the applicant of
  * (_iv_) a period of probation in addition
to a sentence of imprisonment,
  * (_v_) a period of probation in addition
to a fine, or
  * (_vi_) a fine in addition to a sentence of
imprisonment,
two years have elapsed since the later of
the termination of the sentence of im-
prisonment, the termination of the period
of probation or the payment of the fine,
as the case may be; or
  * (_b_) in any other case, until five years
have elapsed since the date from which
the two year period provided in para
graph (a) would have been computed,
if that paragraph had been applicable to
the applicant.
(3) For the purposes of this section, in
calculating the period of any sentence of
imprisonment imposed on an applicant
there shall be included, in addition to any
time spent by him in custody pursuant to
that sentence, any period of statutory re
mission granted to him in respect thereof.
(4) Upon completion of its inquiries, the
Board shall report the result thereof to the
Minister with its recommendation as to
whether a pardon should be granted but,
if the Board proposes to recommend that
a pardon should not be granted, it shall,
before making such a recommendation,
forthwith so notify the applicant and ad
vise him that he is entitled to make any
representations to the Board that he be
lieves relevant; and the Board shall con
sider any oral or written representations
made to it by or on behalf of the applicant
within a reasonable time after any such
notice is given and before making a report
under this subsection.
(5) Upon receipt of a recommendation
from the Board that a pardon should be
granted, the Minister shall refer the rec
ommendation to the Governor in Council
who may grant the pardon which shall be
in the form set out in the schedule.

## EFFECT OF GRANT OF PARDON

**5.** The grant of a pardon
  * (_a_) is evidence of the fact that the
Board, after making proper inquiries,
was satisfied that an applicant was of
good behaviour and that the conviction
in respect of which the pardon is granted
restricting the generality of the fore
going, removes any disqualification to
which the person so convicted is, by
reason of such conviction, subject by
virtue of any Act of the Parliament of
Canada or a regulation made there
under.

## CUSTODY OF EECOEDS

**6.** (1) The Minister may by order in
writing addressed to any person having the
custody or control of any judicial record
of a conviction in respect of which a par
don has been granted, require that person
to deliver such record into the custody of
the Commissioner.
(2) Any record of a conviction in respect
of which a pardon has been granted that
is in the custody of the Commissioner or
of any department or agency of the Gov
ernment of Canada shall be kept separate
and apart from other criminal records, and
no such record shall be disclosed to any
person, nor shall the existence of the
record or the fact of the conviction be
disclosed to any person, without the prior
approval of the Minister who shall, before
granting such approval, satisfy himself
that the disclosure is desirable in the in
terests of the administration of justice or
for any purpose related to the safety or
security of Canada or any state allied or
associated with Canada.

## REVOCATION

**7.** A pardon may be revoked by the
Governor in Council
  * (_a_) if the person to whom it is granted
is subsequently convicted of a further
offence under an Act of the Parliament
of Canada or a regulation made there
under; or
  * (_b_) upon evidence establishing to the
satisfaction of the Governor in Council
  * (_i_) that the person to whom it was
granted is no longer of good conduct,
or
  * (_ii_) that such person knowingly made
a false or deceptive statement in rela
tion to his application for the pardon,
or knowingly concealed some material
particular in relation to such applica
tion.

## GENERAL

**8.** No application form for or relating to
  * (_a_) employment in any department as
defined in section 2 of the Financial
Administration Act,
  * (_b_) employment by any Crown corpora
tion as defined in Part VIII of the
Financial Administration Act,
  * (_c_) enrolment in the Canadian Forces,
or
  * (_d_) employment upon or in connection
with the operation of any work, under
taking or business that is within the
legislative authority of the Parliament
of Canada,
shall contain any question that by its
terms requires the applicant to disclose a
conviction in respect of which he has been
granted a pardon that has not been re
voked.

**9.** Nothing in this Act in any manner
limits or affects the provisions of the
Criminal Code, or of the Letters Patent
Constituting the Office of Governor General
of Canada, relating to pardons, except that
sections 6 and 8 apply in respect of any
pardon granted either before or after the
commencement of this Act pursuant to any
authority conferred by those provisions.

## OFFENCES

**10.** Any person who violates any provi
sion of this Act is guilty of an offence
on summary conviction.

## SCHEDULE

# PARDON

## HIS EXCELLENCY THE COVER-
NOR GENERAL IN COUNCIL, on the
recommendation of the Parole Board, is
pleased hereby to grant to
a pardon in respect of the
offence of
of which he was convicted on the
day of , 19 ;
And this pardon is evidence of the fact
that the Parole Board, after making pro-
per inquiries, was satisfied that the said
was of
good behaviour and that the conviction
should no longer reflect adversely on his
character and, unless subsequently re-
voked, this pardon vacates the conviction
in respect of which it is granted and, with-
out restricting the generality of the fore-
going, removes any disqualification to
which the said
is, by reason of such conviction, subject by
virtue of any Act of the Parliament of
Canada or a regulation made thereunder.
Given at Ottawa, this day
of , 19
By Order,
Deputy Registrar
General
