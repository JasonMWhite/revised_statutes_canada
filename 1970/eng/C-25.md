being wound up under the Winding-up

made an authorized assignment or against
which a receiving order has been made
under the Bankruptcy Act, proof of which
has been made in accordance with the
Bankruptcy Act, or
  * (_iii_) in the case of any other company,
proof of which might be made under the
Bankruptcy Act, but if the amount so
provable is not admitted by the company,
such amount shall be determined by the
court on summary application by the
company or by the creditor ;
  * (_c_) the amount of a secured claim shall be
the amount, proof of which might be made
in respect thereof under the Bankruptcy Act
if such claim were unsecured, but such
amount if not admitted by the company

pending proceedings under the Winding-up
Act, or the Bankruptcy Act, be established
by proof in the same manner as an
unsecured claim under the Winding-up Act
or the Bankruptcy Act, as the case may be,
and in the case of any other company such
amount shall be determined by the court
on summary application by the company
or by the creditor.
(2) Notwithstanding subsection (1), the com
pany may admit the amount of a claim for
purposes, and nothing in this Act or the
Winding-up Act or the Bankruptcy Act prevents
a secured creditor from voting at a meeting
of secured creditors or any class of them in
respect of the total amount of a claim as
admitted. R.S., c. 54, s. 11.

a judge of the court to which the appeal lies
and upon such terms as to security and in
other respects as such judge or court directs.
R.S.,c. 54, s. 12.

**14.** (1) Such appeal shall lie to the highest
court of final resort in or for the province in
which the proceeding originated.
(2) All appeals shall be regulated as far as
possible according to the practice in other
cases of the court appealed to, but no appeal
herein authorized shall be entertained unless,
within twenty-one days from the rendering of
the order or decision, or within such further
time as the court appealed from, or, in the
Yukon Territory, a judge of the Supreme
Court of Canada, allows, the appellant has
taken proceedings therein to perfect his
appeal, nor unless within such time he has
made a deposit or given sufficient security
according to the practice of the court appealed
to that he will duly prosecute the said appeal
and pay such costs as may be awarded to the
respondent and comply with any terms as to
security or otherwise imposed by the judge
giving leave to appeal. R.S., c. 54, s. 13.

**15.** (1) An appeal shall by leave of a judge
of the Supreme Court of Canada lie to that
Court from the highest court of final resort in
or for the province or territory in which the
proceeding originated.
(2) The Supreme Court of Canada shall
have jurisdiction to hear and to decide
according to its ordinary procedure any
appeal so permitted and to award costs.
(3) No such appeal to the Supreme Court
of Canada shall operate as a stay of
proceedings unless the judge who permits
such appeal so orders, and to the extent to
which he orders, and the appellant shall not
be required to provide any security for costs,
but unless he provides security for costs, in
an amount to be fixed by the judge permitting
the appeal, he shall not be awarded costs in
the event of his success upon such appeal.
(4) The decision of the Supreme Court of
Canada on any such appeal is final and
conclusive. R.S., c. 54, s. 14.

**16.** Every order made by the court in any
province in the exercise of jurisdiction
conferred by this Act in respect of any
compromise or arrangement shall also have
full force and effect in all the other provinces
and shall be enforced in the court of each of
the other provinces in the same manner in all
respects as if the order had been made by the
court so enforcing it. R.S., c. 54, s. 15.

**17.** All courts having jurisdiction under
this Act and the officers of such courts
respectively shall severally act in aid of and
be auxiliary to each other in all matters in
this Act provided for, and an order of the
court seeking aid with a request to another of
the said courts shall be deemed sufficient to
enable the latter court to exercise in regard to
the matters directed by the order such
jurisdiction as either the court that made the
request or the court to which the request is
made could exercise in regard to similar
matters within their respective jurisdictions.
R:S., c. 54, s. 16.

**18.** (1) The Governor in Council may
make, alter or revoke and may delegate to
the judges of the several courts exercising
under this Act the power to make,
alter or revoke general rules not inconsistent
the terms of this Act for carrying into
the objects thereof.
(2) Such rules shall not extend the jurisdic
of the court.
(3) All general rules as from time to time
made by the Governor in Council shall be
laid before Parliament within three weeks
after they are made, or if Parliament is not
then sitting within three weeks after the
beginning of the next session.
(4) All such rules shall be judicially noticed
and shall have effect as if enacted by this
Act. R.S., c. 54, s. 17.

## PART III

Act do not apply to any compromise or
arrangement to which this Act applies. R.S.,

applied conjointly with the provisions of any
Act of Canada or of any province, authorizing
or making provision for the sanction of
compromises or arrangements between a
company and its shareholders or any class of
them. R.S., c. 54, s. 19.
