pursuant to an Act of the legislature of the
province (hereinafter referred to as the
"provincial law"), that throughout the year
satisfies the following criteria:
  * (_a_) the plan is administered and operated
on a non-profit basis by a public authority
appointed or designated by the government
of the province (hereinafter referred to as
the "provincial authority") that is respon
sible in respect of the administration and
operation of the plan to the government of
the province or to a provincial minister
designated by the government of the
province for such purpose, and that is
subject in respect of its accounts and
financial transactions to audit by such
person as is charged by law with the audit
of the accounts of the province;
(6) the plan provides for and is administered
and operated so as to provide for the
furnishing of insured services upon uniform
terms and conditions to all insurable
residents of the province, by the payment
of amounts in respect of the cost of insured
services in accordance with a tariff of
authorized payments established pursuant
to the provincial law or in accordance with

the medical care insurance plan of that
other province, on the same basis as though
such persons had not been absent from the
province or had not ceased to be residents
of the province, as the case may be.
(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (l)(a), a
plan established by an Act of the legislature
of a province does not fail to satisfy the
criteria set forth in that paragraph by reason
only that it authorizes the designation by the

with the receipt and payment of accounts
rendered for insured services or authorizes
any agency or agencies so designated to
receive premiums or other amounts payable
under the provincial law for remission to the
provincial authority, if under the provincial

medical care insurance plans of participat
ing provinces

of insured persons in the province at the

care insurance plans of those provinces,

year of the numbers of insured persons in
each of the participating provinces at the
end of each month in the year.

of insured persons in a province at the end of
each month in the year is an amount

means of determining, through a system of
registration or premium payments, the
number of insured persons in the province
at a particular time in the year, by
multiplying
  * (_i_) the population of the province for the
year divided by the number of months in
the year
by
  * (_ii_) the number of full months in the year
registration or premium payments, the
number of insured persons in the province
at a particular time in the year, by dividing
  * (_i_) the aggregate of the numbers of
insured persons estimated by the province
to have been in the province at the end
of each full month in the year during
which insured services were furnished
pursuant to the medical care insurance
plan of the province
by
  * (_ii_) the number of months in the year;
and

the year was a province described in
paragraph (a) and for another part of the
year was a province described in paragraph
(6), by adding
  * (_i_) the number obtained by the applica
tion of paragraph (a) in respect of that
part of the year during which the province
was a province described in paragraph
(a), and
