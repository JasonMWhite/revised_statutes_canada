tional groups within each occupational cate-
g Orv p ursuan t to subsection (1), shall specify

under the program of classification revision
undertaken by the Civil Service Commission
prior to the 13th day of March 1967.
(3) As soon as possible after the 13th day

comprised of employees included in that
occupational category may be made by an
employee organization, which day shall not,

(4) During the initial certification period,
unit of employees in respect of whom Her

to the bargaining unit is in effect or has
been entered into but is not yet in effect,
the term of that collective agreement ; and

application jointly by both parties to an

and including the final level in the grievance
process, and

action.

Expenses of Adjudication

**97.** (1) Where an adjudicator is named in

not specify such method, the named adjudica
tor s remuneration and his expenses shall be
borne equally by the parties.
(2) Where a grievance is referred to adjudi
cation but is not referred to an adjudicator
named in a collective agreement, and the

agent is liable to pay and shall remit to the
Board such part of the costs of the adjudication
as may be determined by the Secretary of the
Board with the approval of the Board, except

to arise out of the collective agreement or
arbitral award, and
(6) the obligation, if any, is not an
obligation the enforcement of which may
be the subject of a grievance of an employee
in the bargaining unit to which the collective
agreement or arbitral award applies,
either the employer or the bargaining agent
may, in the prescribed manner, refer the
matter to the chief adjudicator who shall
personally hear and determine whether there
is an obligation as alleged and whether, if
there is, there has been a failure to observe or
to carry out the obligation.
