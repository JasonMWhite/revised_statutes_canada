hour of that record. R.S., c. 29, s. 47.

**48.** Where a registered mortgage is dis-
charged, the registrar shall, on the production
of the mortgage deed, with a receipt for the
mortgage money endorsed thereon, duly
signed and attested, make an entry in the
register book to the effect that the mortgage
has been discharged, and on that entry being
made the estate, if any, that passed to the

circumstances, if any), it would hâve vested if
the mortgage had not been made. R.S., c. 29,
s. 48.

**49.** Where there are more mortgages than
one registered in respect of the same ship or
share, the mortgagees are, notwithstanding
any express, implied or constructive notice,

according to the date of each mortgage itself
R.S., c. 29, s. 49.

**50.** Except as far as may be necessary for
making a mortgaged ship or share available
as a security for the mortgage debt, the
mortgagee shall not by reason of the mortgage
be deemed the owner of the ship or share, nor

to be owner thereof. R.S., c. 29, s. 50.
5 1. Every registered mortgagee has power
absolutely to dispose of the ship or share in
respect of which he is registered, and to give
effectuai receipts for the purchase money ;
but where there are more persons than one
registered as mortgagees of the same ship or
share, a subséquent mortgagee shall not,
except under the order of the court of
compétent jurisdiction, sell the ship or share
without the concurrence of every prior
mortgagee. R.S., c. 29, s. 51.

share is not affected by any act of bankruptcy
committed by the mortgagor after the date of
the record of the mortgage, notwithstanding
that the mortgagor at the commencement of
his bankruptcy had the ship or share in his
possession, order or disposition, or was reputed
owner thereof, and the mortgage shall be
preferred to any right, claim, or interest
therein of the other creditors of the bankrupt
or any trustée or assignée on their behalf.
R.S., c. 29, s. 52.

**53.** A registered mortgage of a ship or
share may be transferred to any person, and
the instrument effecting the transfer shall be
in the form prescribed by the Governor in
Council, and on the production of such
instrument the registrar shall record it by
entering in the register book the name of the
transférée as mortgagee of the ship or share,
and shall by mémorandum under his hand
indicate on the instrument of transfer that it
has been recorded by him, stating the date
and hour of the record. R.S., c. 29, s. 53.

**54.** (1) Where the interest of a mortgagee
in a ship or share is transmitted on marriage,
death or bankruptcy, or by any lawful means
other than by a transfer under this Act, the
transmission shall be authenticated by a
déclaration of the person to whom the interest
is transmitted.
(2) The déclaration shall be accompanied,
if the transmission has taken place by virtue

gagee, by such évidence as is, for the time
being, receivable in courts of justice as proof
of the title of persons claiming under any
bankruptcy,

a copy of the register of the marriage or
other légal évidence of the célébration

cy by such évidence as is, by the law of the
province, required to establish it.
(3) In the case of transmission of a builder's

port at which the recorded vessel has been
recorded, if the déclarant résides at or
within five miles of the custom-house of the
port, or
  * (_b_) if beyond that distance, in the présence
of any registrar, chief officer of customs or
justice of the peace.
(4) The registrar, on receipt of the déclara-
tion and the production of the évidence
aforesaid, shall enter the name of the person
entitled under the transmission in the register
book, or the record book, as the case may be,
as mortgagee of the ship or share or vessel, as
the case may be, in respect of which the
transmission has taken place. R.S., c. 29, s. 54.
Certificates of Mortgage and Sale

**55.** A registered owner, if desirous of
disposing by way of mortgage or sale of the
ship or share in respect of which he is
registered at any place out of Canada, may
apply to the registrar of the ship 's port of

enable him to do so by granting a certificate
of mortgage or a certificate of sale. R.S., c.

  * (_e_) every mortgage that is so registered as
aforesaid on the certificate has priority over
ail mortgages of the same ship or share
created subsequently to the date of the
entry of the certificate in the register book ;
and, if there are more mortgages than one
so registered, the respective mortgagees
claiming thereunder are, notwithstanding
any express, implied, or constructive notice,
entitled one before the other according to
the date at which each mortgage is registered
on the certificate, and not according to the
date of the mortgage ;
(/) subject to the foregoing rules, every
mortgagee whose mortgage is registered on

regard to intervening acts and circum-
stances, if any) hâve vested, if the mortgage
had not been made ; and
  * (_h_) on the delivery of any certificate of
mortgage to the registrar by whom it was
granted he shall, after recording in the
register book, in such manner as to préserve
its priority, any unsatisfied mortgage regis-
tered thereon, cancel the certificate, and
enter the fact of the cancellation in the
register book; and every certificate so
cancelled is void to ail intents. R.S., c. 29,
s. 59.

**60.** The following rules shall be observed

  * (_c_) a sale made in good faith thereunder to
a purchaser for valuable considération shall

by whom the power was given dying before
the making of such sale ;

power was given ;
  * (_e_) a transfer made to a person qualified to
be the owner of a British ship shall be by a
bill of sale in accordance with this Act ;

to be the former port of registry of the ship,
and the last mentioned registrar shall there-
upon make a mémorandum of the sale in
his register book, and the registry of the
ship in that book shall be considered as
closed, except as far as relates to any
unsatisfied mortgages or existing certificates
of mortgage entered therein ;
  * (_i_) on such registry anew the description of
the ship contained in its original certificate
of registry may be transferred to the new
register book, without the ship being
resurveyed, and the déclaration to be made
by the purchaser shall be the same as would
be required to be made by an ordinary
transférée ;
0) if the ship is sold to a person not
qualified to be the owner of a British ship,
the bill of sale by which the ship is
transferred, the certificate of sale, and the
certificate of registry shall be produced to
a registrar or British registrar or consular
officer, and that registrar or officer shall
retain the certificates of sale and registry,

that book shall be considered as closed,
except so far as relates to any unsatisfied
mortgages or existing certificates of mort-
gage entered therein ;
  * (_fc_) if, on a sale being made to a person not
qualified to be the owner of a British ship,
default is made in the production of such
certificates as are mentioned in paragraph
0), that person shall be considered not to
hâve acquired any title to or interest in the
ship ; and the person upon whose application

certificate of sale, that certificate shall be
delivered to the registrar by whom it was

several matters and things that hâve been
done thereunder, the registrar may, with the

name by which it is proposed to register that
ship is refused by the Minister, or any
requirements of the régulations are not

the owner of any ship measured under Rule
II, in that Schedule may at any subséquent
period apply to the Minister to hâve the ship
re-measured under Rule I, and the Minister
may thereupon, upon payment of such fee as
he may authorize, direct the ship to be re-
measured accordingly, and the number denot-

uniform application thereof , and the effectuai
carrying out of the principle of measurement
therein adopted. R.S., c. 29, s. 94.

**95.** (1) In the case of any ship propelled
by steam or other power requiring engine
room, an allowance shall be made for the
space occupied by the propelling power, and
the amount so allowed shall be deducted from
the gross tonnage of the ship ascertained as
mentioned in section 94, and the remainder
shall, subject to any déductions hereinafter
mentioned, be deemed to be the register
tonnage of the ship, and that déduction shall
be estimated as follows, namely,
  * (_o_) as regards ships propelled by paddle
wheels in which the tonnage of the space
solely occupied by and necessary for the
proper working of the boilers and machinery
is above twenty per cent and under thirty
per cent of the gross tonnage of the ship,
the déduction shall be thirty-seven one-
hundredths of the gross tonnage ; and in
ships propelled by screws, in which the
tonnage of such space is above thirteen per
cent and under twenty per cent of the gross
tonnage, the déduction shall be thirty-two
one-hundredths of the gross tonnage ;
  * (_b_) as regards ail other ships, the déduction
shall, if the Minister and the owner both
agrée thereto, be estimated in the same
manner; but either may, in his discrétion,
require the space to be measured and the

whenever the measurement is so required,
the déduction shall consist of the tonnage
of the space actually occupied by or required
to be enclosed for the proper working of the
boilers and machinery, with the addition in
the case of ships propelled by paddle wheels
of one-half, and in the case of ships
propelled by screws of three-fourths of the
deemed to form part oî the space ; and the
measurement of the space shall be governed
by Rule III in Schedule I ; and
  * (_c_) the déduction for the space occupied by
the propelling power of a ship shall not in
any case exceed fifty-five per cent of that
portion of the tonnage of the ship that
remains after deducting from the gross
tonnage any déductions allowed under
section 97, but this paragraph does not
apply to steamships constructed for the
purpose of towing vessels so long as they
are exclusively employed as tugs, but if and
when employed for the carriage of passen-
gers, cargoes, or stores, or using graving

the repairing of vessels the register tonnage
on which dues based on register tonnage
may be levied by any harbour or dock
authority shall be ascertained in manner
otherwise provided by this Act.
(2) Such portion of the space above the
crown of the engine room and above the
upper deck as is framed in for the machinery
or for the admission of light and air shall not
be included in the measurement of the space
occupied by the propelling power, except in
pursuance of a request in writing to the
Minister by the owner of the ship, but shall
not be included in pursuance of that request
unless
  * (_a_) that portion is first included in the
measurement of the gross tonnage, and
(6) a surveyor of ships certifies that the
portion so framed in is reasonable in extent
and is so constructed as to be safe and
seaworthy, and that it cannot be used for
any purpose other than the machinery or
for the admission of light and air to the
machinery or boilers of the ship.
(3) Goods or stores shall not be stowed or
carried in any space measured for propelling
power, and if the same are so carried in any

**96.** (1) Notwithstanding section 95, where
the case of a ship to which this section
the gross tonnage of the ship, then in
ascertaining the register tonnage of the ship
the déduction allowable for that space under
section 95
  * (_a_) shall be computed in accordance with
subsection (2) of this section, but
(6) shall not be made unless the surveyor
of ships is satisfied that the space provided
for the working of the boilers and machinery
and the ventilation and lighting of that
space are adéquate.
(2) Subject to the lirait imposed by para-
graph 95(l)(c), the amount of the déduction
shall be as follows, namely,
  * (_a_) if the tonnage of the space solely
occupied by and necessary for the proper
working of the boilers and machinery is
thirteen per cent of the gross tonnage of
the ship, the amount shall be thirty-two per
cent of that gross tonnage, and
  * (_b_) if the tonnage of that space is less than
thirteen per cent of the gross tonnage of
the ship, the amount shall be thirty-two per
cent of that gross tonnage proportionately
reduced.

wheels, subsection (1) has effect as if for the
références to thirteen and thirty-two per cent
there were substituted respectively références
to twenty and thirty-seven per cent.

writing to that effect to the Minister, to
any ship in respect of which the surveyor
of ships is for the time being satisfied as
mentioned in paragraph (1)(6).
(5) Where the making of the déduction
mentioned in subsection (1) or its computation
in accordance with subsection (2) dépends on
the surveyor of ships being satisfied as
mentioned in paragraph (1)(6), and the
déduction
  * (_a_) has been made and so computed but a
surveyor of ships, on inspecting the ship,
fails to be satisfied as mentioned in
of ships, on inspecting the ship, is satisfied
as mentioned in paragraph (1)(6),
the surveyor shall inform the Minister and
the register tonnage of the ship shall be
altered accordingly. 1956, c. 34, s. 3.

**97.** (1) In measuring or re-measuring a
ship for the purpose of ascertaining the ship's
register tonnage, the following déductions
shall be made from the space included in the
measurement of the tonnage, namely,

section, other than a déduction for a space
occupied by seamen or apprentices, and
certified as aforesaid, are subject to the
following provisions, namely :
  * (_a_) the space deducted must be certified by
a surveyor of ships as reasonable in extent
and properly and efficiently constructed for
the purpose for which it is intended ;
  * (_b_) there must be permanently marked in
or over every such space a notice stating
the purpose to which it is to be applied,
and that while so applied it is to be
deducted from the tonnage of the ship ; and
  * (_c_) the déduction on account of space for
storage of sails must not exceed two and a
half per cent of the tonnage of the ship.
R.S., c. 29, s. 96; 1960-61, c. 32, s. 7.
Provisions aa to çg. In the case of a screw steamship that,
c^"of'certib °^ ^^^ 26th day of August 1889, had an engine
steamships room allowance of thirty-two per cent of the
gross tonnage of the ship, and in which any
crew space on deck has not been included in
the gross tonnage, whether its contents hâve
been deducted therefrom or not, the crew
space shall, on the application of the owner
of the ship, or by direction of the Minister,
be measured and its contents ascertained and
added to the register tonnage of the ship;
and if it appears that with that addition to
the tonnage the engine room does not occupy
more than thirteen per cent of the tonnage of
the ship, the existing allowance for engine
room of thirty-two per cent of the tonnage
shall be continued. R.S., c. 29, s. 97.
Measurement of 99. In the case of a ship constructed with
double bottoms ^ double bottom for water ballast, if the space
between the inner and outer plating thereof
is certified by a surveyor of ships to be not
available for the carriage of cargo, stores, or
fuel, then the depth required by the provisions
of Rule I of Schedule I relating to the
measurement of transverse areas shall be
taken to be the upperside of the inner plating
of the double bottom and that upper side
shall, for the purposes of measurement, be
deemed to represent the floor timber referred
to in that Rule. R.S., c, 29, s. 98.
Tonnage once IQO. Whenever the tonnage of any ship
ascertained tonnage of ship tobe,, "*^ oeeu ascertained .l-jj and registered -.^j- m accord- j
ance with the tonnage régulations of this Act,
that tonnage shall henceforth be deemed to
be the tonnage of the ship, and shall be
repeated in every subséquent registry thereof,
unless any altération is made in the form or
capacity of the ship, or unless it is discovered
that the tonnage of the ship has been
erroneously computed ; and in either of those
cases the ship shall be re-measured, and its
tonnage determined and registered according
to the tonnage régulations of this Act. R.S.,
in Council that the tonnage régulations
of this Act hâve been adopted by any foreign
country, and are in force there, the Governor
in Council may order that the ships of that
country shall, without being re-measured in a
Commonwealth country, be deemed to be of
the tonnage denoted in their certificates of
registry or other national papers, in the same
manner, to the same extent, and for the same
purposes as the tonnage denoted in the
Canadian certificate of registry of a British
ship is deemed to be the tonnage of that ship,
and any space shown by the certificate of
registry or other national papers of any such
ship as deducted from tonnage on account of
being occupied by seamen or apprentices, and
appropriated to their use, shall be deemed to
hâve been certified under this Act, and to
comply with the provisions of this Act that
apply to such a space in the case of Canadian
ships unless a surveyor of ships certifies to
the Minister that the construction and the
equipment of the ship with respect to that
space do not come up to the standard required
under this Act in the case of a Canadian ship
and if any question arises whether the
construction and the equipment of the ship
do come up to the required standard a
surveyor of ships may inspect the ship for
purpose of determining whether such a
certificate should be given by him or not.
(2) The Governor in Council may limit the
time during which the order is to remain in
opération, and make the order subject to such
conditions and qualifications, if any, as the
Governor in Council may deem expédient,
and the opération of the order shall be limited
and modified accordingly.
(3) Where it is made to appear to the
Minister that the tonnage of any foreign ship,
as measured by the rules of the country to
which the ship belongs, materially differs
from that which would be the ship 's tonnage
if measured under this Act, the Minister may
order that, notwithstanding any order of the
Governor in Council for the time being in
force under this section, any of the ships of
that country may, for ail or any of the
purposes of this Act, be re-measured in
accordance with this Act. R.S., c. 29, s. 100.

**102.** (1) Where any ship, British or foreign,
the cubical contents forming the ship 's register
tonnage, timber, stores, or other goods, ail

register tonnage the tonnage of the space
occupied by those goods at the time at which
the dues become payable.
(2) The space so occupied shall be deemed
^^ ^^ ^^^ space limited by the area occupied
by the goods and by straight lines enclosing
a rectangular space sufficient to include the
goods.

ascertained by an officer of the Department
of Transport or National Revenue in the
manner directed as to the measurement of
poops or other closed-in spaces by Rule I in
Schedule I and when so ascertained shall be
entered by him in the ship's officiai log book,
and also in a mémorandum that he shall
deliver to the master, and the master shall,
when the said dues are demanded, produce
that mémorandum in like manner as if it were
the certificate of registry, or, in the case of a
foreign ship, the document équivalent to a
certificate of registry, and in default is liable
to the same penalty as if he had failed to
produce the said certificate or document.
(4) Nothing in this section applies to any
ship employed exclusively in trading or going
from place to place in any river or inland
water of which the whole or part is in Canada
or to deck cargo carried by a ship while
engaged in the coasting trade of Canada.
R.S., c. 29, s. 101.

tonnage rates on ships may, if they think fit,
with the consent of the Minister, levy those
tonnage rates upon the register tonnage of
the ships as determined by the tonnage
régulations of this Act, notwithstanding that

régulations under which those rates are levied
provides for levying the same upon some
différent System of tonnage measurement.
R.S., c. 29, s. 105.

sent, that question shall be decided by the
proper authority, and, in deciding any
question under this provision, the proper

convenience of the seaman and to the expense
involved, and also, where that is the case, to

justice of the peace, or any officer authorized
to administer an oath, stating the number of
days during which each distressed seaman bas

complément of his crew and the actual number
of seamen employed on board his ship, and

maintenance and passage of every seaman so
conveyed, maintained, and provided for by
him, exceeding the number, if any, wanted to
make up the complément of his crew, such
sum per diem as the Minister allows.
(4) If any master of a Canadian ship fails
without reasonable cause to comply with this
section in the case of any distressed seamen,
he is for each offence liable to a fine not
exceeding five hundred dollars. R.S., c. 29,
s. 312.

deems requisite for the temporary relief in

tressed seamen not otherwise entitled to relief
under this Act or under the laws of the
country to which the ship belongs.
(2) Any expenses incurred for shipwrecked,
destitute or otherwise distressed seamen under
this section are a debt to the Crown from the
master, owner or agent of the vessel to which
the distressed seaman belonged and may be
recovered by the Minister on behalf of the
Crown in the same manner as expenses
incurred out of Canada for distressed seamen
of sea-going vessels registered in Canada, are
recovered. R.S., c. 29, s. 313.

Minister to examine the ship, is sufficient
to allow the ship to make a voyage in
safety; and

inspector, the hull, boilers, machinery and
equipment of such ship are in good order

**434.** (1) The Governor in Council may
make régulations (hereafter in this section
referred to as the "timber cargo régulations")
as to the conditions on which timber may be
carried as cargo out of Canada in any
uncovered space on the deck of any Load

(2) The timber cargo régulations shall
contain such régulations as appear to the
Governor in Council to be necessary for the
purpose of giving effect to paragraph 2 of
Article 6 of the Load Line Convention.

cargo régulations may prescribe generally the
conditions on which timber may be carried as
aforesaid in any Load Line ship either on ail
voyages or on any particular class of voyages

master of any ship is liable to a fine not more
than twenty-five hundred dollars and not less
than one hundred dollars; but in any
proceedings against a master in respect of a
contravention of the timber cargo régulations,
it is a good defence to prove that the
contravention was due solely to déviation or
delay, the déviation or delay being caused
solely by stress of weather or other circum-
stances that neither the master nor the owner
nor the charterer, if any, could hâve prevented
or forestalled.
(8) The régulations made under this section

vessel at the time, unless it is shown to the
satisfaction of the court that the circumstances
of the case made a departure from the
régulation necessary.
(4) The Collision Régulations, together
the provisions of this Part relating
thereto, or otherwise relating to collisions,
be observed by ail foreign ships within
jurisdiction, and in any case arising
in a Canadian court concerning matters

Provisions as to Collisions, etc.

**638.** (1) Where, by the fault of two or

the manner provided by law.
(5) For the purpose of this Act, the
expression "freight" includes passage money
and hire, and référence to damage or loss
caused by the fault of a vessel shall be

salvage or other expenses, conséquent upon
that fault, recoverable at law by way of
damages. R.S., c. 29, s. 648.

**639.** (1) Where loss of life or personal
injuries are suffered by any person on board
a vessel owing to the fault of that vessel and
of any other vessel or vessels, the liability of
the owners of the vessels is joint and several.

as depriving any person of any right of
defence on which, independently of this
section, he might hâve relied in an action
brought against him by the person injured, or
any person or persons entitled to sue in
respect of such loss of life, or to affect the
right of any person to lirait his liability, in
cases to which this section relates, in the
manner provided by law. R.S., c. 29, s. 649.

**640.** (1) Where loss of life or personal

proportion in which the vessel was in fault,
those owners may recover by way of contribu-
tion the amount of the excess from the owners
of the other vessel or vessels to the extent to
which those vessels were respectively in fault ;
but no amount shall be so recovered that
could not, by reason of any statutory or
contractual limitation of, or exemption from,
liability, or could not for any other reason
hâve been recovered in the first instance as
damages by the persons entitled to sue
therefor.
(2) In addition to any other remedy pro-
vided by law, the person entitled to any such
contribution as aforesaid bas, for the purpose

rights and powers as the persons entitled to
sue for damages in the first instance. R.S., c.
29, s. 650.

crew and passengers, if any, such assistance
as may be practicable, and as may be
necessary to save them from any danger
caused by the collision, and to stay by the
and also the names of the ports from which
it cornes and to which it is bound.
(2) Failure of the master or person in charge
of a vessel to comply with this section, does
not raise any presumption of law that the
collision was caused by his wrongful act,
neglect or default. R.S., c. 29, s. 651.

**642.** (1) When a steamship has sustained
or caused any accident occasioning loss of life

R.S., c. 29, s. 653.

**644.** Any enactment that confers Admirai-
has effect as though références to
damage included références to damages
for loss of life or personal injury, and
accordingly proceedings in respect of such

any person on board that vessel, caused by
the fault of the former vessel, whether such
vessel is wholly or partly in fault, unless
proceedings therein are commenced within
two years from the date when the damage or
loss or injury was caused, and an action is not
maintainable under this Part to enforce any
contribution in respect of an overpaid propor-
tion of any damages for loss of life or personal

period been any reasonable opportunity of
arresting the défendant vessel within the
jurisdiction of the court, or within the
territorial waters of the country to which the
plaintiff's ship belongs or in which the
plaintiff résides or has his principal place of
business, extend any such period to an extent
sufficient to give such reasonable opportunity.
R.S., c. 29, s. 655.

**646.** Sections 638 to 645 apply to any
persons other than the owners responsible for
the fault of the vessel as though the expression
"owners" included such persons, and in any
case where, by virtue of any charter or démise,
or for any other reason, the owners are not
for the navigation and manage-
of the vessel, those sections shall be read
though for références to the owners there
substituted références to the charterers
other persons for the time being so

exclusion of any claimants who do not come
in within a certain time, and as to requiring
from the owner, and as to payment
any costs, as the Court thinks just.

such Court, instead of exercising in person
the powers conferred upon him by subsection
(1) may, by order of his court, commit to any
District Judge in Admiralty of such Court the
power to détermine as aforesaid, whereupon
such District Judge may proceed as if he were,
and with the powers of, the judge to whom
such application of such owner was made.
(4) In making a distribution under this
section of the amount determined to be the

subsequently be established before a court
outside Canada in respect of that liability,
postpone the distribution of such part of the
amount as it deeras appropriate.
(5) No lien or other right in respect of any
ship or property shall affect the proportions

the crew of a ship and to any servant of the
owner or of any person described in paragraphs
  * (_a_) to (c) where any of the events mentioned
in paragraphs 647(2)(a) to (d) occur, whether
with or without his actual fault or privity.

évidence concerning the dimensions of the
ship as it is found practicable to furnish, give
a certificate under his hand stating what
would, in his opinion, hâve been the tonnage

such liability or any other liability incurred
on the occasion giving rise to such claim,
and the Court is satisfied that if the claim
is established the amount for which the
guarantee was given or such part thereof as
corresponds to the claim will be actually
available to the claimant ; and

limit additional security is given which
together with the guarantee is for an
amount not less than such limit.

a port of a country that is declared, pursuant
to subsection (3), to be a Convention country,
and the port
  * (_a_) is the port where the event giving rise
to the claim in respect of which the ship or

of any security is by itself or together with
any other amount not less than the limit
set by section 647 shall be determined as of
the time at which such security is given;
and
  * (_c_) where only part of the amount for which
a guarantee is given in respect of a liability
is available to a claimant, that part shall
not be taken to correspond to his claim if
any other part of the amount may be
available to any other claimant in respect
of a liability to which no limit is set by
section 647. 1964-65, c. 39, s. 37.

**655.** (1) No judgment or decree for a claim
founded on a liability to which a limit is set
by section 647 shall be enforced by the Court,
except so far as it is for costs, if security for
an amount not less than such limit has been
given in Canada or elsewhere in respect of
that liability or any other liability arising on
the same occasion and the Court is of the
opinion that the security is satisfactory and
is satisfied that the amount for which it was
given or such part thereof as corresponds to
the claim will be actually available to the
person in whose favour the judgment or decree
was given or made.

## SCHEDULE I

## RULES AS TO THE INIEASUREMENT

## OF TONNAGE

## RULE I
(1) MeMSXJREMENT OF SHIPS TO BE BEGISTERED ; AN'D OTHER
SHIPS OF WHICH THE HOLD IS CLE.\R — LEKGTHS — MeaSUre the
length of the ship in a straight line along the upper side of
the tonnage deck from the inside of the inner plank (average
thickness), at the side of the stem to the inside of the midship
stem timber or plank there, as the case may be (average
thickness), deducting from this length what is due to the rake
of the bow in the thickness of the deck, and what is due to the
rake of the stem timber in the thickness of the deck, and also
what is due to the rake of the stern timber in one-third of the
round of the beam ; divide the length so taken into the number
of equal parts required by the following Table, according to
the class in such Table to which the ship belongs:
Table
Class L Ships of which the tonnage deck is according to the
above measurement 50 feet long or under, into 4 equal parts:
Class 2. Ships of which the tonnage deck is according to the
above measurement above 50 feet long and not exceeding 120,
into 6 equal parts:
Class 3. Ships of which the tonnage deck is according to the
above measurement above 120 feet long, and not exceeding
180, into 8 equal parts:
Class 4. Ships of which the tonnage deck is according to the
above measurement above 180 feet long, and not exceeding
225, into 10 equal parts :
Class 5. Ships of which the tonnage deck is according to the
above measurement above 225 feet long, into 12 equal parts.
In the case of a break or breaks in a double bottom for water
ballast, the length of the vessel is to be taken in parts accord-
ing to the number of breaks, and each part divided into a
number of equal parts according to the class in the above table
to which such length belongs. However, lengths of 30 feet or
less shall be divided into 2 equal parts.
In ail cases where the top of the double bottom rises from
the centre line to the margin plate (hip tank top), the transverse
areas shall be measured in two parts, the depth being divided
into 5 (or 7 if midship depth exceeds 16 feet) equal parts and
then the lowest division thus ascertained shall be sub-divided
into four equal parts. The sum of the two parts shall be deemed
to be the transverse area. In ail cases where the top of the
double bottom is horizontal, it will be sufficient to measure the
transverse areas in one part as in the case for ordinary fîoors.
(2) Transverse areas— Then, the hold being sufficiently
cleared to admit of the required depths and breadths being
properly taken, find the transverse area of the ship at each
point of division of the length (or each point of division of the
parts of the length, as the case may require) as follows:
Measure the depth at each point of division, from a point at a
exceed 16.0 feet, di'i'ide each depth into four (five in the case
of a hip tank top) equal parts; then measure the inside
horizontal breadth at each of the three points of division (four
for hipped tanks), and also at the upper and lower points of
the depth. extending each measurement to the average thick-
ness of that part of the ceiling which is between the points of
measurement; number thèse breadths from above, i.e., num-
bering the upper breadth one. and so on down to the lowest
breadth. (fifth in the case of hipped tanks) ; multiply the
second and fourth by four and the third by two; add thèse
products together and to the sum add the first breadth and
the fifth; multiply the quantity thus obtained by one-third of
the common interval between the breadths, and the product
shall be deemed the transverse area (or trans^'erse area of the
upper part of the section in the case of hip tank top; then
find the area between the fifth and lower point of the depth by
dividing the depth between such point.s into four equal parts
and measure the horizontal breadths at the three points of
division and also at the upper and lower points, and proceed
as before. and the sum of two parts shall be deemed to be the
transverse area) ; but if the midship depth exceed sixteen
feet, divide each depth into six (seven in the case of hip tank
top) equal parts instead of four (or five), and measure as before
directed the horizontal breadths at the five points of division
(six points in case of hip tank top), and also at the upper and
lower points of the depth ; number them from above as before ;
multiply the second, fourth and sixth by four, and the third
and fifth by two; add thèse products together, and to the sum
add the first breadth and the seventh ; multiply the quantity
thus obtained by one-third of the common interval between
the breadths, and the products shall be deemed the transverse
area (or trans\-erse area of the upper part of the section in the
case of hip tank top; then find the lower part of the area as
before directed, and add the two parts together, and the sum
shall be deemed to be the transverse area).
(3) CoMPUiATiox FEOM .VRE-VS— Having thus ascertained the
transverse area at each poiat of division of the length of the
ship, (or each point of diiision of the parts of length, as the
case may require), as required by the above table, proceed to
ascertain the register toimage under the tonnage deck in the
following manner: — Xtmiber the areas respectively 1, 2, 3, &c..
Xo. 1 being at the extrême limit of the length at the bow, (or
of each part of the length), and the last ntmiber at the extrême
limit of the length at the stem, (or the extrême limit at the
after end of each part of the length) ; then whether the length
be di\-ided according to the table into four or 12 parts, as in
classes 1 and 5, or anj' intermediate number, as in classes 2.
3, and 4, multiply the second and everj' even numbered area
by four, and the third and e^'erj- odd numbered area (except
the first and last) by two; add thèse products together, and to
the stmi add the first and last if they j-ield anything; multiply
the quantity thus obtained by one-third of the common interval
the areas, and the product wiU be the cubical contents
of the space, (or cubical contents of each part if the ship is
in parts) under the tonnage deck; di\-ide this product,
(or if measured in parts the products of the several parts added
*See section 99 of this Act,
(4) In case of decks above the tonnage deck— If the ship
bas a third deck, commonly called a spar deck, the tonnage of
the space between it and the tonnage deck shall be ascertained
as follows: — Measure in feet the inside length of the space at
the middle of its height from the plank at the side of the stem
to the lining on the timbers at the stern, and divide the length
into the same number of equal parts into which the length of
the tonnage deck is divided as above directed; measure (also
at the middle of its height) the inside breadth of the space at
each of the points of division, also the breadth at the stem
and the breadth at the stern: number them successively 1, 2,
3, &c., commencing at the stem ; multiply the second and ail
the other even numbered breadths by four, and the third and
ail the other odd numbered breadths (except the first and last)
by two; to the sum of thèse products add the first and last
breadths; multiply the whole sum by one-third of the common
interval between the breadths. and the resuit will give in
superficial feet the mean horizontal area of the space; measure
the mean height of the space, and multiply by it the mean
horizontal area, and the product will be the cubical contents
of the space ; divide this product by one hundred and the
quotient shall be deemed to be the tonnage of the space and
shall be added to the tonnage of the ship ascertained as afore-
said. If the ship has more than three decks, the tonnage of each
space between decks above the tonnage deck shall be severally
ascertained in manner above described, and shall be added to
the tonnage of the ship ascertained as aforesaid.
(5) POOP, DECK-HOUSE, F0RECASTLE, AND ANY OTHER CLOSED-IN
SPACE — If there be a break, a poop, or any other permanent
closed-in space on the upper deck available for cargo or stores,
or for the berthing or accommodation of passengers or crew,
the tonnage of that space shall be ascertained as follows:
Measure the internai mean length of the space in feet, and
divide it into two equal parts; measure at the middle of its
height three inside breadths, namely, one at each end and the
other at the middle of the length : then to the sum of the end
breadths add four times the middle breadth, and multiply the
whole sum by one-third of the common interval between the
breadths, the product will give the mean horizontal area of the
space; then measure the mean height, and multiply by it the
mean horizontal area ; divide the product by one hundred, and
the quotient shall be deemed to be the tonnage of the space,
and shall be added to the tonnage under the tonnage deck
ascertained as aforesaid. Provided that no addition shall be
made in respect of any building erected for the shelter of deck
passengers, and approved by the Minister.

## RULE II
(I) Measurement of ships not requiring registry with
CARGO ON BOARD AND SHIPS WHICH CANNOT BE MEASURED UNDËR
RULE I — LENGTH — BRE.4DTH —GIRTING OF THE SHIP — MeaSUre the
length on the uppermost deck from the outside of the outer
plank at the stem to the aft side of the stern post, deducting
therefrom the distance between the aft side of the stern post
the rabbet of the stern post at the point where the counter
crosses it; measure also the greatest breadth of the ship
first marked on the outside of the ship on both sides thereof
the height of the upper deck at the ship's sides. girt the ship
at the greatest breadth in a direction perpendicular to the keel
from the height so marked on the outside of the ship on the one
side to the height so marked on the other side by passing a
chain under the keel; to half the girth thus taken add half the
main breadth ; square the sum ; multiply the resuit by the
length of ship taken as aforesaid; then multiply this prod-
uct by the factor .0017 (seventeen ten-thousandths) in the case
of ships built of wood, and .0018 (eighteen ten-thousandths)
in the case of ships built of steel and the product shall be
deemed the register tonnage of the ship, subject to any addi-
tions and déductions under this Act.
(2) POOP, DECK-HOUSE, FORECASTLE. AND OTHER CLOSED-IN
SPACES ON UPPER DECK — If there be a break, a poop, or other
closed-in space on the upper deck. the tonnage of that space
shall be ascertained by multiplying together the mean length,
breadth, and depth of the space, and dividing the product by
100, and the quotient so obtained shall be deemed to be the
tonnage of the space, and shall be added to the tonnage of the
ship ascertained as aforesaid.
RULE ni
Measurement of allowance for engine-room space in
STEAM or MOTOR SHIPS
  * (_i_) Measure the mean depth of the space from its crown to
the ceilmg at the limber strake, measure aJso three, or, if
necessary, more than three breadths of the space at the middle
of its depth, taking one of those measurements at each end,
and another at the middle of the length ; take the mean of
those breadths; measure also the mean length of the space be-
tween the foremost and aftermost bulkheads or limits of its
length, excluding such parts, if any, as are not actually occupied
by or required for the proper working of the machinery :
multiply together thèse three dimensions of length, breadth,
and depth. divide the product by one hundred and the resuit
shall be deemed the tonnage of the space below the crown;
then find the cubical contents of the space or spaces, if any,
above the crown aforesaid, which are framed in for the ma-
chinerj' or for the admission of light and air, by multiplying
together the length, depth, and breadth thereof; add such con-
tents to the cubical contents of the space below the crown;
divide the sum by 100; and the resuit shall (subject to the
provisions hereinafter contained) be deemed to be the tonnage
of the space.
  * (_ii_) If in any ship in which the space for propelling power
is to be measured the engines and boilers are fitted in separate
compartments, the contents of each shall be measured severally
in like manner, according to the above rules, and the sum of
their several results shall be deemed to be the tonnage of the
said space.
  * (_iii_) In the case of screw vessels in which the space for
propelling power is to be measured, the contents of the shaft
trunk shall be ascertain( d by multiplying together the mean
length, breadth, and depth of the trunk, and dividing the
product by 100.
  * (_iv_) If in any ship in which the space aforesaid is to be
any altération be made in the length or capacity of
spaces, or if any cabins be fitted in the space. the ship shall
deemed to be a ship not registered until re-measurement.

## RULE IV
Meastjrement of open ships—In ascertaining the tonnage
of open ships the upper edge of the upper strake is to form
the boundarj' line of measurement, and the depths shall be
taken from an athwartship line, extended from upper edge to
upper edge of the said strake at each division of the length.
