## PART I

## EXPROPRIATION
Acquisition and Abandonment of Land

**3.** Any interest in land, including any of
the interests mentioned in section 5, that,
in the opinion of the Minister, is required
by the Crown for a public work or other
public purpose may be expropriated by the
Crown in accordance with the provisions of
this Part.

**4.** (1) Whenever, in the opinion of the
Minister, any interest in land is required
by the Crown for a public work or other
public purpose, the Minister may request
the Attorney General of Canada to register
a notice of intention to expropriate such
interest, signed by the Minister, setting
forth
  * (_a_) a description of the land;
  * (_b_) the nature of the interest intended
to be expropriated and whether such
interest is intended to be subject to any
existing interest in the land;
  * (_c_) an indication of the public work or
other public purpose for which the inter
est is required; and
  * (_d_) a statement that it is intended that
the interest be expropriated by the
Crown.
(2) Upon receiving from the Minister a
request to register a notice of intention
described in this section, the Attorney
General of Canada shall cause such notice,
together with a plan of the land to which
the notice relates, to be registered in the
office of the registrar for the county, district
or registration division in which the land is
situated, and, after causing such investiga
and searches to be made respecting the
of the title to the land as appear to him
to be necessary or desirable, the Attorney
General of Canada shall furnish to the
Minister a report setting forth the names
and latest known addresses, if any, of the
persons appearing to have any right, estate
or interest in the land, so far as he has been
able to ascertain them.
(3) Where, in the opinion of the Minis
ter, the interest to which a notice of inten
tion described in this section relates is
required by the Crown for a purpose
related to the safety or security of Canada
or a state allied or associated with Canada
and it would not be in the public interest
further to indicate such purpose, a state
ment in the notice to the effect that the
interest is required by the Crown for such
a purpose is sufficient compliance with
paragraph (l)(c) without further indica
tion thereof.
(4) Subject to subsection (3) the Minis
ter shall, for the purposes of sections 7
and 8 and to the extent that it appears to
him to be practicable and in the public
interest to do so, make available to any
person upon request any additional in
formation that is available to the Minister
as to the public work or other public pur
pose for which the interest to which a
notice registered under this section relates
is required by the Crown.
(5) Where a notice or plan registered
under this section contains any omission,
mis-statement or erroneous description, a
corrected notice or plan may be registered,
which shall be deemed to relate back to
the day the original notice or plan was
registered.
(6) A notice registered under this sec
tion is not invalid by reason only that it
does not set forth the nature of the interest
intended to be expropriated and, in such
case, the interest intended to be expro
priated includes all the interests in the land
to which the notice relates.
(7) A notice registered under this sec
tion is not invalid by reason only that it
land to which the notice relates, and, in
such case, the interest intended to be
expropriated is not subject to that existing
interest.
(8) Where it appears to the Attorney
General of Canada that any land or inter
est in land to which a notice registered
under this section relates belongs to Her
Majesty in right of any province, he shall
thereupon cause the attorney general of
the province to be notified of the registra
tion and of the particulars thereof.

condition or otherwise;
  * (_b_) an easement, profit or servitude;

land that might be conferred by the
owner of the land, whether or not such
right, if conferred by the owner, could be
asserted against a subsequent owner of
the land;
  * (_d_) any restriction on the use of land
that might be assumed by covenant or
other agreement, whether or not such re
striction, if assumed by the owner of the
land, could be asserted against a subse
quent owner thereof; and
  * (_e_) the exclusive possession of land for
a limited time or for a definite or indefi
nite period, subject to such conditions or
limitations, if any, as may be specified
in the notice.

**6.** (1) Where a notice of intention to
expropriate an interest in land has been
registered, the Minister shall cause a copy
of the notice
  * (_a_) to be published in at least one issue
of a publication, if any, in general circu
lation within the area in which the land
is situated, within thirty days after the
registration of the notice, and
  * (_b_) to be sent to each of the persons
whose names are set forth in the report
of the Attorney General of Canada re

notice,
and forthwith after causing a copy thereof
to be sent by registered mail to each of the
persons referred to in paragraph (b), shall
cause such notice to be published in the
Canada Gazette.
(2) A notice of intention shall be
deemed to be given on the day on which it
is published in the Canada Gazette under
subsection (1), and where any notice so
published contains an omission, mis-state
ment or erroneous description, a corrected
notice may be published in the Canada
Gazette, which shall be deemed to relate
back to the day the original notice was
published therein.
(3) There shall be included in any notice
or copy thereof published or sent as de
scribed in subsection (1) a statement of
the provisions of section 7 as that section
applies to the intended expropriation of the
interest to which the notice relates.

tended expropriation of an interest in land
to which a notice of intention relates may,
within thirty days from the day the notice
is given, serve on the Minister an objec

dress of such person and indicating the
nature of his objection, the grounds on
which his objection is based and the nature
of his interest in the matter of the intended
expropriation.

the period of thirty days referred to in
section 7, the Minister shall, if he has been
served with an objection under that section,

hearing be conducted with respect to
an objection or objections, he shall im
request the Attorney General of
Canada to appoint a hearing officer to con
duct such a hearing and the Attorney

a suitable person, who is not a person em
ployed in the Public Service as defined in
subsection 2(1) of the Public Service
Superannuation Act, to be a hearing officer
for that purpose.
(3) A hearing officer appointed under
this section shall be paid such remunera
tion and expenses as may be fixed by the
Attorney General of Canada with the ap
proval of the Treasury Board.
(4) A hearing officer appointed under
this section shall
  * (_a_) as soon as possible after his appoint
ment and in any case not later than
seven days from the date thereof, fix a
suitable time and place for the public
hearing and cause notice of the time and
place so fixed to be given by pub
lishing it in at least one issue of a
publication, if any, in general circulation
within the area in which the land is situ
ated and by sending it to each of the
persons whose names are set forth in
the report of the Attorney General of
Canada referred to in subsection 4(2)
and each other person who served an
objection on the Minister;
  * (_b_) at the time and place so fixed for

ing thereat who served an objection on
the Minister or such of those persons as

to the Minister on the nature and
grounds of the objections;
  * (_c_) make such inspection of the land
as he deems necessary and receive and
consider any written representations filed
with him before or at the hearing by
any person who served an objection on
the Minister; and
  * (_d_) within thirty days after his appoint

grounds of the objections made.
(5) A hearing officer is not required to
give any notice, hold any hearing or take
any other action required by subsection (4)
with respect to any objection served on the
Minister under section 7 and may at any

faith.
(6) Any person who may be heard at a
public hearing under this section may be
represented by counsel at the hearing.
(7) A public hearing under this section

maximum amount as may be authorized by
any tariff of costs prescribed by the
Governor in Council for the purpose of this
section, in respect of the costs of any person
who served an objection on the Minister
that were incurred by such person in assert
ing the objection, and upon the certificate
of the Minister the Minister of Finance
shall, out of the Consolidated Revenue
Fund, cause to be paid to such person the
amount so certified in respect of those
costs.
(10) Where, for any reason, a hearing
officer appointed to conduct a public hear
ing under this section fails to do so or to
prepare and submit to the Minister a report
as and when required by this section, the
shall so notify the Attorney
of Canada who shall immediately
another hearing officer for that
(11) Where, at any time before a notice
of intention is registered, the Governor in
Council is of the opinion that the physical
possession or use by the Crown of the land
to the extent of the interest intended to be
expropriated is, by reason of special circum
stances, urgently required and that to order
that a public hearing be conducted with
respect thereto would occasion a delay
prejudicial to the public interest, the
Governor in Council may direct that no
order be made by the Minister under sub
section (1) with respect to the intended
expropriation and, in any such case, a
statement to that effect shall be included
in the notice of intention.

**9.** (1) Where a notice of intention has
been given, the Minister may,
  * (_a_) at any time,
  * (_i_) if no objection is filed with him
under section 7 within the period of
thirty days referred to in that section,
  * (_ii_) if an objection has been filed with
him under section 7 within the period
of thirty days referred to in that
section, after receiving and consider
ing the report of a hearing officer ap
pointed to conduct a public hearing
with respect thereto, or
  * (_iii_) whether or not an objection has
been filed with him under section 7,
if a statement to the effect described
in subsection 8(11) has been included
in the notice of intention,
confirm the intention, in the manner
provided in section 12; or
  * (_b_) at any time abandon the intention;
except that if, upon the expiration of one
hundred and twenty days from the day the
notice was given, the Minister has not con
firmed the intention in the manner pro
vided in section 12, he shall be deemed to
have abandoned the intention.
(2) Whenever, at the time of confirming
intention to expropriate an interest in
land, the Minister is of the opinion that a
more limited interest only is required by
the Crown for a public work or other pub
lic purpose, he may confirm the intention
to expropriate the more limited interest, in
which case he shall be deemed to have
abandoned the intention to expropriate the
remainder of such interest.

**10.** (1) Where the Minister has aban
doned an intention to expropriate an inter-
es ^ m l an d otherwise than by confirming
an intention to expropriate a more limited
interest therein, he shall forthwith cause a
notice of abandonment of the intention to
be sent
  * (_a_) to each of the persons then appear
ing to have any right, estate or interest
in the land, so far as the Attorney Gen
eral of Canada has been able to ascer
tain them, and each other person who
served an objection on the Minister
under section 7; and
  * (_b_) to the Attorney General of Canada,
who shall thereupon confirm the aban
donment by causing such notice to be
registered in the office of the registrar
where the notice of intention was regis
tered.
(2) Where an intention to expropriate
an interest or remainder of an interest in
land has been abandoned, compensation in
accordance with this Part shall be paid by
the Crown to the person who was the owner
of the interest or remainder at the time
when the notice of intention was registered.

**11.** Where the Minister, after receiving
and considering a report of a hearing officer
appointed to conduct a public hearing with
respect to an objection served on the Min
ister by any person under section 7, has
confirmed an intention to expropriate an
interest in land, or a more limited interest
therein, in the manner provided in section
12, he shall, at the written request of the
person who served the objection, furnish to
such person a copy of the report of the
hearing officer and, where effect was not
to the objection, a statement of the
that the Minister had for not giv
effect thereto.

**12.** (1) The Minister may confirm an
intention to expropriate an interest in land
to which a notice of intention relates, or a
more limited interest therein, by requesting
the Attorney General of Canada to register
a notice of confirmation, signed by the
Minister, setting forth,
  * (_a_) if the interest expropriated is the
same as the interest to which the notice
of intention relates, a statement that the
intention to expropriate such interest is
confirmed; or
  * (_b_) if the interest expropriated is a more
limited interest than the interest to which
the notice of intention relates, a state
ment that the intention to expropriate
the interest to which the notice of inten
tion relates is confirmed except as ex
pressly specified in the statement.
(2) Upon receiving from the Minister a
request to register a notice of confirma
tion described in this section, the Attorney
General of Canada shall cause such notice
to be registered in the office of the registrar
where the notice of intention was registered,
and if the land to which the notice of
confirmation relates is more limited in area
than the land described in the notice of
intention, shall cause a revised plan of the
land to which the notice of confirmation
relates to be registered therewith.

**13.** Upon the registration of a notice of
/* -
confirmation,
  * (_a_) the interest confirmed to be expro
priated becomes and is absolutely vested
in the Crown; and
  * (_b_) any other right, estate or interest is,
as against the Crown or any person
claiming through or under the Crown,
thereby lost to the extent that such right,
estate or interest is inconsistent with the
interest confirmed to be expropriated.

**14.** (i) where a notice of confirmation
nas been registered, the Minister shall,
( a ) forthwith after the registration of
the notice, cause a copy thereof to be
sent to each of the persons then appear
ing to have any right, estate or interest
in the land, so far as the Attorney Gen
eral of Canada has been able to ascer
tain them, and each other person who
served an objection on the Minister
under section 7; and
  * (_b_) within ninety days after the regis
tration of the notice, or, if at any time
before the expiration of those ninety
days an application has been made
under section 16, within the later of
  * (_i_) ninety days after the registration
of the notice, or
  * (_ii_) thirty days after the day the ap
plication is finally disposed of,
make to each person who is entitled to
compensation under this Part in respect
of an expropriated interest to which the
notice of confirmation relates, an offer
in writing of compensation, in an amount
estimated by the Minister to be equal
to the compensation to which that person
is then entitled under this Part in respect
of that interest, not conditional upon
the provision by that person of any re
lease or releases and without prejudice
to the right of that person, if he accepts
the offer, to claim additional compensa
tion in respect thereof.
(2) Where, in any case, it is not prac-
ticable for the Minister to make an offer
of compensation under this section in
respect of an expropriated interest within
the applicable period described in para
graph (1) (b) , the Minister shall make such
an offer as soon as practicable after the
expiration of that period and in any event
before any compensation is adjudged by
the Court to be payable under this Part-
in respect thereof, but, in any such case,
interest as described in subsection 33(4) is
payable in addition to any other interest
payable under section 33 to the person
entitled to compensation in respect thereof.
(3) An offer of compensation made to a
person under this section in respect of an
expropriated interest shall be based on a
written appraisal of the value of such
sent to such person at the time of the
of the offer.
(4) There shall be included in any copy
of a notice of confirmation sent to any
person as described in paragraph (1) (a)
a statement of the provisions of section 27
as that section applies to him, and there
shall be included in any offer in writing
sent to any person as described in para
graph (1) (6) a statement to the effect
that such offer is not conditional upon the
provision by him of any release or releases
and is made without prejudice to his right,
if he accepts the offer, to claim additional
compensation in respect of the expropriated
interest.

**15.** Where an offer of compensation has
Deen ma d e to any person under section 14,
the full amount thereof shall, forthwith
upon the acceptance of the offer, be paid
to that person.

**16.** (1) Where the Attorney General of
Canada, at any time after the registration
of a notice of confirmation, is in doubt as
to the persons who had any right, estate
or interest in the land to which the notice
relates or as to the nature or extent thereof,
he may apply to the Court to make a
determination respecting the state of the
title to the land or any part thereof im
mediately before the registration of the
notice, and to adjudge who had a right,
estate or interest in the land at that time,
and the nature and extent thereof.
(2) An application under this section
shall in the first instance be made ex parte
and the Court shall fix a time and place
for the hearing of the persons concerned
and give directions as to
  * (_a_) the persons who are to be served
with the notice of the hearing, the con
tents of the notice and the manner of
service thereof;
  * (_o_) the material and information to be
submitted by the Attorney General of
Canada or any other persons; and
Part what persons had any right, estate
or interest in the land to which the notice
of confirmation relates immediately before
the registration of the notice, and the
nature and extent thereof, or direct an
issue or issues to be tried for the purpose
of enabling the Court to make such an
adjudication.
(4) An adjudication made by the Court
for the purposes of this Part shall be
deemed to be a final judgment of the
Court and, subject to variation on appeal,
if any, shall finally determine for all pur
poses of this Part what persons had any
right, estate or interest in the land to
which the notice of confirmation relates
immediately before the registration of the
notice, and the nature and extent thereof.

**17.** (1) Notwithstanding section 13, the
Crown becomes entitled to take physical
possession or make use of any land to
which a notice of confirmation relates, to
the extent of the interest expropriated, only
at such of the following times as is ap
plicable, namely:
  * (_a_) at the time of the registration of
the notice of confirmation, if at that
time no other person who was the owner
of an interest therein immediately before
the registration of the notice of con
firmation is in occupation of the land;
(6) at such time, if any, after the regis
tration of the notice of confirmation as
physical possession or use of the land
to the extent of the interest expropriated
is given up to the Crown without any
notice under paragraph (c) having been
sent to the persons described in that
paragraph; or
  * (_c_) in any other case, at such time after
the registration of the notice of confir
mation as
  * (_i_) the Minister has sent a notice
to each of the persons appearing to-
have had any right, estate or interest
therein at the time of the registration
of the notice of confirmation, so far as
the Attorney General of Canada has
been able to ascertain them, or, where
an application has been made under
section 16 and has been finally dis
posed of, to each of the persons
adjudged to have had an interest
therein immediately before the regis
tration of the notice of confirmation,
that such physical possession or
use is required by the Crown on and
after the expiration of such period as
is specified in the notice, being not
less than ninety days after the sending
of the notice to each of those persons,
and either that period has expired or
such physical possession or use has
been given up to the Crown before
the expiration of that period, and
  * (_ii_) the Minister has made an offer
under section 14 to each of the persons
then entitled to compensation under
this Part in respect of an interest
therein.
(2) Where, at any time before or after
a notice of confirmation has been regis
tered, the Governor in Council is of the
opinion that the physical possession or use
by the Crown of the land to which the
notice relates to the extent of the interest
expropriated or intended to be expropriated
is, by reason of special circumstances,
urgently required, the Governor in Council
may direct
  * (_a_) that there be substituted for the
ninety days referred to in paragraph
(1) (c) such lesser number of days as in
his opinion the circumstances require; or
(6) where an application has been made
under section 16 but has not been finally
disposed of, that such physical possession
or use may be taken or made by the
Crown notwithstanding that no offer has
then been made under section 14.

**18.** (1) Where, at any time before any
compensation is paid in respect of an inter
est expropriated, the Minister is of the
opinion that the interest is not or is no
longer required by the Crown for a public
work or other public purpose, or that a
limited interest only is so required,
Minister may give notice that he in
to abandon the interest or the re
mainder of the interest, as the case may be,
by causing a copy of the notice to be sent
to each of the persons mentioned in para
graph 17(1) (c), each of whom may, within
thirty days from the day a copy of the
notice was sent to him, serve on the
Minister a notice in writing that he elects to
  * (_a_) accept the abandonment, and have
the interest or remainder revest in him
to the extent that the abandonment
would operate to revest it in him; or
(6) reject the abandonment.
(2) If each of the persons to whom a
notice is sent under subsection (1) serves a
notice on the Minister under subsection (1)
that he elects to accept the abandonment,
the Minister may cause a notice of aban
donment of the interest expropriated or the
remainder of the interest, as the case may
be, to be sent to each of those persons and
to the Attorney General of Canada, who
shall thereupon confirm the abandonment
by causing such notice to be registered in
the office of the registrar where the notice
of confirmation was registered.

**19.** Where an interest expropriated or a
remainder of an interest in land is con
firmed to be abandoned, the interest
expropriated thereupon revests in the
persons from whom it was taken or the
persons entitled to claim through or under
them, or the land thereupon revests in
those persons subject to the more limited
interest therein retained by the Crown, as
the case may be.

**20.** Every registrar shall receive and
permanently preserve in his office such
notices and plans as the Attorney General
of Canada causes to be registered under
this Part, and shall endorse thereon the
day, hour and minute when the same were
received by him as the time of registration
and make such entries in his records as
make their registration of public

**21.** Unless questioned by the Crown,
  * (_a_) a document purporting to be signed
by the Minister shall be conclusively
deemed to have been so signed;
  * (_b_) it shall be conclusively deemed that
  * (_i_) all of the interests to which a
notice of intention relates are,
  * (_ii_) a more limited interest only to
which a notice of confirmation relates
is, or
  * (_iii_) an interest stated in a notice of
abandonment to be abandoned or the
remainder of the interest, as the case
may be, is not or is no longer,
in the opinion of the Minister required
by the Crown for a public work or other
public purpose; and
  * (_c_) it shall be conclusively deemed that,
upon being caused to be registered by
the Attorney General of Canada in the
office of the registrar where a notice of
intention to expropriate an interest in
land was registered, a document pur
porting to be a notice of confirmation of
the intention to expropriate that interest
or a more limited interest only in the
land is a notice of confirmation thereof
thereupon registered in accordance with
this Part.

**22.** A document purporting to be certified
by a registrar to be a true copy of a notice
or plan registered under this Part at a time
stated in the certificate is, without proof
of the official character or signature of the
registrar, evidence of the facts stated
therein and of the registration of the notice
or plan at the time so stated.
Compensation

**23.** (1) Compensation shall be paid by
the Crown to each person who, immedi
ately before the registration of a notice of
confirmation, was the owner of a right,
estate or interest in the land to which the
notice relates, to the extent of his expro
priated interest, the amount of which com
pensation shall be equal to the aggregate of
  * (_a_) the value of the expropriated inter
est at the time of its taking, and
  * (_b_) the amount of any decrease in value
of the remaining property of the owner,
determined as provided in section 25.
(2) For the purposes of this section and
sections 24 and 25, the time of the taking
of an expropriated interest is,
  * (_a_) where an election has been made
under subsection (3) by the owner there
of, the time specified by him in his elec
tion; and
  * (_b_) in any other case, the time when the
notice of confirmation was registered.
(3) Where no copy of a notice of con
firmation was sent to a person whose name
is set forth in the report of the Attorney
General of Canada referred to in subsec
tion 4(2) or who served an objection on
the Minister under section 7 until a time
more than ninety days after the registra
tion of the notice, such person may, at any
time before any compensation is paid to
him in respect of any expropriated interest
of which he was the owner immediately
before the registration of the notice of con
firmation, elect to have the value of such
interest determined at either
  * (_a_) the time when the notice of confir
mation was registered, or
(6) the time when the copy of the notice
of confirmation was sent to him,
as specified by him in his election.

**24.** (1) The rules Set forth in this Sec-
tion shall be applied in determining the
value of an expropriated interest.
(2) Subject to this section, the value of
an expropriated interest is the market value
thereof, that is to say, the amount that
would have been paid for the interest if, at
the time of its taking, it had been sold in
the open market by a willing seller to a
willing buyer.
(3) Where the owner of an expropriated
interest was in occupation of any land at
the time the notice of confirmation was
registered and, as a result of the expro
priation, it has been necessary for him to
  * (_a_) the market value thereof determined
as set forth in subsection (2), or
(5) the aggregate of
  * (_i_) the market value thereof deter
mined on the basis that the use to
which the expropriated interest was
being put at the time of its taking was
its highest and best use, and
  * (_ii_) the costs, expenses and losses
arising out of or incidental to the
owner s disturbance including moving
to other premises, but if such cannot
practically be estimated or determined,
there may be allowed in lieu thereof
a percentage, not exceeding fifteen, of
the market value determined as set
forth in subparagraph (i),
plus the value to the owner of any
element of special economic advantage
to him arising out of or incidental to
his occupation of the land, to the
extent that no other provision is made
by this paragraph for the inclusion
thereof in determining the value of the
expropriated interest;
and in any case where the Crown has taken
physical possession or made use of the
land upon the expiration of a period of
notice to the owner shorter than the ninety
days mentioned in paragraph 17(1) (c),
there shall be added to the value of the
expropriated interest otherwise determined
under this section an additional amount
equal to ten per cent thereof.
(4) Notwithstanding subsection (3),
where any parcel of land to which a notice
of confirmation relates had any building
or other structure erected thereon that was
specially designed for use for the purpose
of a school, hospital, municipal institution
or religious or charitable institution
or for any similar purpose, the use of
which building or other structure for that
purpose by the owner has been rendered
impracticable as a result of the expropria-
the value of the expropriated interest
is, if the expropriated interest was and,
but for the expropriation, would have con
tinued to be used for that purpose and
at the time of its taking there was no
general demand or market therefor for
that purpose, the greater of
  * (_a_) the market value of the expropriated
interest determined as set forth in sub
section (2), or
  * (_b_) the aggregate of
  * (_i_) the cost of any reasonably alterna
tive interest in land for that purpose,
and
  * (_ii_) the cost, expenses and losses aris
ing out of or incidental to moving to
and re-establishment on other prem
ises, but if such cannot practically
be estimated or determined, there may
be allowed in lieu thereof a percentage,
not exceeding fifteen, of the cost deter
mined under subparagraph (i),
minus the amount by which the owner
has improved, or may reasonably be
expected to improve, his position through
re-establishment on other premises;
and in any case where the Crown has
taken physical possession or made use of
the parcel of land upon the expiration of
a period of notice to the owner shorter
than the ninety days mentioned in para
graph 17(1) (c), there shall be added to the
value of the expropriated interest otherwise
determined under this section an additional
amount equal to ten per cent thereof.
(5) For the purposes of subparagraphs
(3) (6) (ii) and (4)(fe)(ii), consideration
shall be given to the time and circum
stances in which a former owner was
allowed to continue in occupation of the
land after the Crown became entitled to
take physical possession or make use there
of, and to any assistance given by the
Minister to enable such former owner to
seek and obtain alternative premises.
of confirmation, being used by the
owner thereof for the purposes of his
residence and the value of the interest
otherwise determined under this section is
less than the minimum amount sufficient
to enable the owner, at the earlier of
  * (_a_) the time of payment to him of any
compensation in respect of the interest,
otherwise than pursuant to any offer
made to him under section 14, or
  * (_b_) the time when the Crown became
entitled to take physical possession or
make use of the land to the extent of
the interest expropriated,
to relocate his residence in or on premises
reasonably equivalent to the premises
expropriated, there shall be added to the
value of the interest otherwise determined
under this section the amount by which
that minimum amount exceeds such value.
(7) Where an expropriated interest was,
immediately before the registration of a
notice of confirmation, owned by the owner
thereof as a leasehold interest, there shall
be substituted for the amount determined
under subparagraph (3) (6) (ii) or (4) (6)
  * (_ii_) , or the amount by which the minimum
amount referred to in subsection (6) ex
ceeds the value of the interest referred to
therein otherwise determined under this
section, as the case may be, such part of
that amount as is appropriate having re
gard to
  * (_a_) the length of the term of the lease
hold interest and the portion of the term
remaining at the time at which the
determination is relevant,
  * (_b_) any right or reasonable prospect of
renewal of the term that the owner of
the leasehold interest had, and
  * (_c_) any investment in the land by the
owner of the leasehold interest and the
nature of any business carried on by him
thereon.
  * (_a_) the value of the expropriated inter
est is the aggregate of
  * (_i_) the value thereof otherwise deter
mined under this section as though it
had not been subject to any security
interest, and
  * (_ii_) the amount of any loss or an
ticipated loss to the owner of the
expropriated interest resulting from a
difference in rates of interest during
the remainder of the period for which
any principal amount payable under
the terms of the security was advanced
(such difference to be calculated on
the basis of an assumed rate of inter
est not in excess of the prevailing rate
of interest for an equivalent security),
to the extent that no other provision
is made by this section for the inclu
sion of an amount in respect of such
loss or anticipated loss in determining
the value of the expropriated interest,
less the value of each security interest
to which the expropriated interest was
subject, determined as provided in para
graph (b) but as though no amount were
included therein by virtue of subpara-
graph (ii) of that paragraph;
  * (_b_) the value of the security interest
is the aggregate of
  * (_i_) the principal amount outstanding
under the terms of the security, and
any interest due or accrued thereunder,
at the time of the registration of the
notice of confirmation, and
  * (_ii_) an amount equal to three times
the interest element, calculated as a
monthly amount, of any payment of
interest or of principal and interest
payable under the terms of the secu
rity at the rate in effect thereunder
immediately before the registration of
the notice of confirmation,
priority but in no case shall the value
of any security interest to which an
expropriated interest was subject exceed
the value of the expropriated interest
otherwise determined under this section
as though it had not been subject to any
security interest, less the value of each
other security interest the value of which
is required by this subsection to be deter
mined in priority thereto; and
  * (_c_) where part only of the interest that
was subject to a security interest was
expropriated, the value of the security
interest is that proportion of the value
thereof otherwise determined under this
subsection as though the whole of the
interest subject to the security interest
had been expropriated, that
  * (_i_) the value of the part only of the
interest, otherwise determined under
this subsection as though it had not
been subject to any security interest,
is of
  * (_ii_) the value of the whole of the
interest otherwise determined under
this subsection as though it had not
been subject to any security interest,
less the same proportion of the interest
element of any payment made under the
terms of the security, between the time
of the registration of the notice of con
firmation and the time of payment of
any compensation in respect of the
security interest, otherwise than pur
suant to any offer made to the owner
thereof under section 14.
(9) In determining the value of an ex
propriated interest, no account shall be
taken of
  * (_a_) any anticipated or actual use by the
Crown of the land at any time after the
expropriation ;
  * (_b_) any value established or claimed to
be established by or by reference to any
transaction or agreement involving the
sale, lease or other disposition of the
interest or any part thereof, where such
transaction or agreement was entered
into after the registration of the notice
of intention to expropriate;
from any knowledge or expectation,
prior to the expropriation, of the public
work or other public purpose for which
the interest was expropriated; or
  * (_d_) any increase in the value of the in
terest resulting from its having been put
to a use that was contrary to law.

**25.** (1) The amount of the decrease in
value, if any, of the remaining property of
an owner is the value of all of his interests
in land immediately before the time of the
taking of the expropriated interest, deter
mined as provided in section 24, minus the
aggregate of
  * (_a_) the value of the expropriated inter
est, and
  * (_b_) the value of all his remaining inter
ests in land immediately after the time
of the taking of the expropriated interest.
(2) For the purpose of paragraph (1) (b) ,
the value of the remaining interests in land
of an owner immediately after the time of
the taking of the expropriated interest shall
be determined as provided in section 24,
except that in determining such value
account shall be taken of any increase or
decrease in the value of any remaining
interest in land of the owner, that imme
diately before the registration of the notice
of confirmation was held by him together
with the expropriated interest, resulting
from the construction or use or anticipated
construction or use of any public work on
the land to which the notice relates or
from the use or anticipated use of that land
for any public purpose.

**26.** (1) The fact of
  * (_a_) an abandonment or revesting under
this Part of an interest or remainder of
an interest in land, or
  * (_b_) any undertaking given on behalf of
the Crown by the Minister, or by any
other person within the scope of his au
thority, to make any alteration, construct
any work or grant or convey any other
land or interest therein,
be taken into account, in connection
all other circumstances of the case,
determining the amount to be paid to
any person claiming compensation for an
expropriated interest.
(2) Where an intention to expropriate
an interest or remainder of an interest in
land has been abandoned, the compensation
payable by the Crown to the owner thereof
is the amount of any actual loss sustained
by such owner, after the time when the
notice of intention was registered and
before the time when the abandonment of
the intention, or the intention to expro
priate a more limited interest, as the case
may be, was confirmed, in consequence of
the registration
  * (_a_) of the notice of intention, where the
intention to expropriate the interest has
been abandoned, or
(6) of the notice of intention in so far as
such notice relates to the remainder of
the interest, where the intention to
expropriate the remainder has been
abandoned;
and, in relation to such compensation, the
provisions of section 29 apply with such
modifications as the circumstances require,
and as though for the reference in para
graph 29(1) (a) to "the registration of the
notice of confirmation" there were sub
stituted a reference to the confirmation of
the abandonment of the intention.

**27.** (1) The Crown shall pay to each
person entitled to compensation under this
Part an amount equal to the legal, appraisal
and other costs reasonably incurred by
him in asserting a claim for such compensa
(2) The costs provided for in subsection
(1) may be taxed by the official responsible
for taxing costs in the Court.
Payment of Compensation

**28.** (1) Where, after an offer of com
pensation in respect of an expropriated
interest has been made under section 14 to
any person (hereinafter in this section
referred to as "the owner"), the owner and
the Minister are unable to agree on the
amount of compensation to which the
owner is then entitled, either the owner or
the Minister may, within sixty days after
the making of the offer, serve on the other
a notice to negotiate settlement of the
compensation to which the owner is then
entitled, and, where any such notice has
been so served, no proceedings under sec
tion 29 shall be instituted, or if instituted
shall be proceeded with, by or on behalf of
either the owner or the Attorney General
of Canada in respect of the expropriation
until the expiration of sixty days from the
serving of the notice, unless before the
expiration of those sixty days the negotia
tor to whom the matter is referred under
subsection (3) has made a report to the
Minister that he has been unable to effect
a settlement and has sent a copy of his
report to the owner.
(2) The Governor in Council, on the
recommendation of the Attorney General
of Canada, may appoint one or more suit
able persons, who are not persons employed
in the Public Service as denned in sub
section 2(1) of the Public Service Super
annuation Act, to act as negotiators for the
purposes of this section, and may fix and
authorize payment of the remuneration and
expenses to be paid to such persons for any
period while they are so acting.
(3) Forthwith after any notice to ne
appointed under subsection (2) who
upon reasonable notice to the owner
and the Minister, meet with them or their
authorized representatives, make such in
spection of the land as he deems neces
sary, receive and consider any appraisals,
valuations or other written or oral evi
dence submitted to him on which either
the owner or the Minister relies for his
estimation of the amount of the compen
sation payable, whether or not such evi
dence would be admissible in proceedings
before a court, and endeavour to effect a
settlement of the compensation payable.
(4) The negotiator shall, within sixty
days from the service of the notice to
negotiate, report to the Minister his suc
cess or failure in the matter of the negoti
ation, and shall thereupon send a copy of
his report to the owner.
(5) Evidence of anything said or of any
admission made in the course of a negotia
tion under this section is not admissible in
any proceedings before a court for the re
covery or determination of the compen
sation payable to the owner.

**29.** (1) Subject to section 28,
  * (_a_) a person entitled to compensation in
respect of an expropriated interest may,
  * (_i_) at any time after the registration
of the notice of confirmation, if no
offer under section 14 has been accept
ed by him, and
  * (_ii_) within one year after the accept
ance of the offer, in any other case,
commence proceedings in the Court by
statement of claim for the recovery of
the amount of the compensation to which
he is then entitled ; or
  * (_b_) the Attorney General of Canada
may at any time after the registration
of the notice of confirmation, whether or
not proceedings under paragraph (a)
have been commenced, file a notice in
the matter in the Court setting forth
  * (_i_) the particulars of the expropria
tion in relation to any parcel of land
to which the notice of confirmation
relates,
  * (_ii_) the names so far as they have
been ascertained of each of the per
sons entitled to compensation in re
spect of an expropriated interest and
the names of the persons who are
to be parties to the proceedings,
  * (_iii_) the amount of any offer made
under section 14 to any of the persons
who are to be parties to the proceed
ings, and
  * (_iv_) such further facts as appear to
be relevant.
(2) A notice filed in the Court under
subsection (1) shall be deemed to com
mence an action or suit involving the per
sons stated therein to be parties to the
proceedings, for the final determination of
the compensation payable or any other
matter or issue arising out of the regis
tration of the notice of confirmation.
(3) Each person stated in a notice filed
in the Court under subsection (1) to be a
party to the proceedings shall, within a
period of thirty days from the day the
notice is served on him or within such
further time as the Court or a judge there
of may allow either before or after the
expiration of that period, serve on the
Attorney General of Canada and file in
the Court a statement of claim in the pro
ceedings, and the Attorney General of
Canada shall, within a period of thirty
days from the day on which that state
ment was served on him, or, if more than
one such statement was served on him,
the latest day on which any such state
ment was served on him, or within such
further time as the Court or a judge there
of may allow either before or after the
expiration of that period, serve on each
such person and file in the Court a state
ment of defence or answer thereto.
before the Court and as if the
proceedings had been commenced by
statement of claim filed by a person stated
in a notice filed in the Court under sub
section (1) to be a party to the pro
ceedings.
(5) Where an application has been
made under section 16 and, at the time any
proceedings arising out of the expropriation
to which the application relates are com
menced by statement of claim as de
scribed in paragraph (l)(a), the applica
tion has not been finally disposed of, the
proceedings shall be stayed until the
application is finally disposed of.
(6) A judgment, whether by consent,
default or otherwise, in any proceedings
under this section bars all further claims
of the parties thereto and of any persons
claiming through or under them, including
any claim in respect of dower or of dower
not yet open or in respect of any mortgage,
hypothec or other right or encumbrance,
and the Court shall declare the amount of
compensation payable and make such order
for the distribution, payment or investment
of any compensation money and for the
securing of the rights of all persons inter
ested, as may be necessary.

**30.** (1) Any compensation agreed to be
payable or the compensation adjudged by
the Court under this Part to be payable in
respect of an expropriated interest stands
in the stead of the interest.
(2) Any compensation agreed to be
payable or the compensation adjudged by
the Court under this Part to be payable
in respect of a security interest described
in subsection 24(8) shall, for all purposes
as between the owner of the interest subject
to the security interest and the owner of
the security interest, be deemed to dis
charge any liability, under the terms of
the security, of the owner of the interest
subject to the security interest, to the ex
of the compensation so agreed or
adjudged to be payable, and, where any
amount or proportion of any amount
described in subparagraph 24(8) (b) (ii)
is included in such compensation, to be in
full satisfaction of any notice or bonus re
quired under the terms of the security in
respect of the prepayment thereof resulting
from the expropriation.

**31.** Where any compensation in respect
of an expropriated interest has been paid
to a person of whose right to claim com
pensation the Crown had notice at the
time of payment, no compensation is pay
able to another person, whether the right
or interest of such other person is derived
from the person to whom compensation has
been paid or otherwise, if under the law of
the province in which the land is situated
the right or interest giving rise to the
claim to compensation of such other person
would have been void or unenforceable
against the Crown had the Crown, at the
time the notice of intention was registered,
been a purchaser of the interest.

**32.** Where any compensation has been
paid to a person in respect of an expropri
ated interest pursuant to an offer made to
him under section 14, the amount so paid
to that person shall be deducted from the
amount of the compensation adjudged by
the Court under this Part to be payable to
him in respect thereof, and where the
amount so paid exceeds the amount so
adjudged to be payable, the excess consti
tutes a debt due to the Crown and may be
recovered by the Crown in any court of
competent jurisdiction.
Interest

**33.** (1) In this section
basic rate" means a rate determined in
the manner prescribed by any order made
from time to time by the Governor in
Council for the purposes of this section,

compensation adjudged by the Court
under this Part to be payable in respect
of an expropriated interest;

(2) Interest is payable by the Crown at
the basic rate on the compensation, from
the date of possession to the date judg
ment is given, except where an offer has
been accepted.

interest is payable by the Crown from the
date of the offer to the date judgment is
given,
  * (_a_) at the basic rate on the amount by
which the compensation exceeds the
amount of the offer, and in addition
(6) at the rate of five per cent per annum
on the compensation, if the amount of
the offer is less than ninety per cent of
the compensation;
and where an offer has been accepted after
the date of possession, interest is payable at
the basic rate on the compensation, from
the date of possession to the date of the
offer.
(4) Where an offer is not made until
after the expiration of the applicable period
described in paragraph 14(1) (b) for the
making of such offer, interest, in addition
to any interest payable under subsection
(2) or (3), is payable by the Crown at
the rate of five per cent per annum on the
compensation, from the expiration of that
period to the day upon which an offer is
made.
(5) Where the Court is of opinion that
any delay in the final determination of the
compensation is attributable in whole or
in part to any person entitled thereto,
or that such person has failed to deliver
up possession within a reasonable time
after demand, the Court may, for the whole
or any part of any period for which he
would otherwise be entitled to interest,
refuse to allow him interest, except that
the Court shall not so refuse by reason
only that an offer made to him was not
accepted.
Entry and Possession

**34.** (1) Where a notice of intention has
been registered, any person authorized in
writing in that behalf by the Minister
may, at any reasonable time upon notice
to a person in occupation of the
land to which the notice relates, enter
upon the land for the purpose of making
any inspection of the land that he is au
thorized by this Part to make, or for the
purpose of making an appraisal of the
value of such land or any interest therein.
(2) Every one who, without lawful ex
cuse, prevents any person from or obstructs
or hinders any person in doing any thing
that such person is authorized by sub
section (1) to do, is guilty of an offence
punishable on summary conviction.

**35.** (1) When the Minister, or a person
acting for him, is prevented from entering
upon or taking physical possession or
making use of any land to the extent of
any interest expropriated under this Part,
a judge of the Court or any judge of a
superior court of a province may, on proof
of the expropriation and, when required,
of the right of the Crown to take physical
possession or make use thereof, and after
notice to show cause given in such manner
and to such persons who shall be parties
to the proceedings as the judge prescribes,
issue his warrant in accordance with the

in the Court under this Part are in the dis
cretion of the Court or, in the case of
proceedings before a judge of the Court or

Court or the judge may direct that the
whole or any part of such costs be paid by
the Crown or by any party to the pro
ceedings.
(2) Where the amount of the compensa
tion adjudged under this Part to be payable
to a party to any proceedings in the Court
under section 29 in respect of an expro
priated interest does not exceed the total
amount of any offer made under section 14
and any subsequent offer made to such
party in respect thereof before the com
mencement of the trial of the proceedings,
the Court shall, unless it finds the amount
of the compensation claimed by such party
in the proceedings to have been unreason
able, direct that the whole of such party s
costs of and incident to the proceedings be
paid by the Crown, and where the amount
of the compensation so adjudged to be pay
able to such party exceeds that total
amount, the Court shall direct that the
whole of such party s costs of and incident

taking down or removal has ceased; and
it has been so replaced, or when the
drain or ditch is completed, the owner

## GENERAL

**41.** (1) The Court may, where a trustee,
guardian or other person representing any
