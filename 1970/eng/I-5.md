made under paragraph ll(l)(a),
the following rules apply:
where a taxpayer, having acquired

time to use it for some other purpose, he
shall be deemed to have disposed of it at
that later time at its fair market value at
that time ;
(6) where a taxpayer, having acquired
property for some other purpose, has
commenced at a later time to use it for the
purpose of gaining or producing income
therefrom, or for the purpose of gaining or
producing income from a business, he shall
be deemed to have acquired it at that later
time at its fair market value at that time ;

cost to him shall be deemed to have been
the fair market value thereof at the time
he so acquired it ;

income therefrom or for the purpose of
gaining or producing income from a business
and in part for some other purpose, the
taxpayer shall be deemed to have acquired,
for the purpose of gaining or producing
income, the proportion of the property that
the use regularly made of the property for
gaining or producing income is of the whole
use regularly made of the property at a
capital cost to him equal to the same
proportion of the capital cost to him of the
whole property; and, if the property has,
in such a case, been disposed of, the proceeds
of disposition of the proportion of the
property deemed to have been acquired for
gaining or producing income shall be
deemed to be the same proportion of the
proceeds of disposition of the whole prop
erty;
(/) where, at any time after a taxpayer has
acquired property, there has been a change

the property for the purpose of gaining
or producing income has increased, he
shall be deemed to have acquired at that
time depreciable property of that class at
a capital cost equal to the proportion of
the fair market value of the property as
of that time that the amount of the
increase in the use regularly made by
him of the property for that purpose is of
the whole use regularly made of the
property, and
  * (_ii_) if the use regularly made of the
property for the purpose of gaining or
producing income has decreased, he shall
be deemed to have disposed at that time
of depreciable property of that class and
the proceeds of disposition shall be
deemed to be an amount equal to the
proportion of the fair market value of the
property as of that time that the amount
of the decrease in the use regularly made
by him of the property for that purpose
is of the whole use regularly made of the
property ;
  * (_g_) where an amount can reasonably be
regarded as being in part the consideration
for disposition of depreciable property of a
taxpayer of a prescribed class and as being

be regarded as being the consideration for
such disposition shall be deemed to be the
proceeds of disposition of depreciable
property of that class irrespective of the
form or legal effect of the contract or
agreement; and the person to whom the
depreciable property was disposed of shall
be deemed to have acquired the property
at a capital cost to him equal to the same
part of that amount ;

entitled to receive from a government,
municipality or other public authority, in
respect of or for the acquisition of property,

than an amount authorized to be paid
under an Appropriation Act and on terms
and conditions approved by the Treasury
Board for the purpose of advancing or
sustaining the technological capability of
Canadian manufacturing or other industry,
the capital cost of the property shall be
deemed to be the capital cost thereof to the
taxpayer minus the amount of the grant,
subsidy or other assistance ;
  * (_i_) where depreciable property of a taxpayer
has, in a taxation year, been disposed of to
a person with whom the taxpayer was
dealing at arm s length, and the proceeds
of disposition include an agreement for sale
of or mortgage or hypothec on land that
the taxpayer has, in the year, sold to a
person with whom he was dealing at arm s
length, in consideration for an amount less
than the principal amount of the agreement
for sale, mortgage or hypothec, there shall
be deducted in computing the proceeds of
disposition the amount, if any, by which
the principal amount of the agreement for
sale, mortgage or hypothec outstanding at
the time of the sale exceeds the consideration
paid by the purchaser to the taxpayer for
the agreement for sale, mortgage or hypo
thec ; and
  * (_j_) where a taxpayer has disposed of an
interest in a partnership, an amount equal
to the part of the consideration for the
disposition of the interest of the taxpayer
in the partnership that can reasonably be
regarded as being in relation to the interest
of the taxpayer in the depreciable property
of a class that was used in the business of
the partnership shall be deemed to be
proceeds of disposition of depreciable
property of that class and the person who
acquired the interest of the taxpayer in the
partnership shall be deemed to have
acquired an interest in property at a capital
cost equal to that amount.

taxpayer for a taxation year, an amount has
been deducted under paragraph l\(\)(y) or
the taxpayer has elected under subsection
11(25) to make a deduction in respect of an
amount that would otherwise have been
deductible under that paragraph, the amount
shall, if it was a payment on account of the
capital cost of depreciable property, be
deemed to have been allowed to the taxpayer
in respect of the property under regulations
made under paragraph ll(l)(a) in computing
the income of the taxpayer
  * (_a_) for the year, or
  * (_b_) for the year in which the property was
acquired,

months from the end of that taxation
year, under conditions satisfactory to the
Minister of Industry, Trade and Com

any conversion cost with respect to a
vessel owned by the taxpayer, or

would, but for this subsection, be payable
by the taxpayer under this Part in respect
of the proceeds of disposition, or satisfac
tory security therefor, as a guarantee that
the proceeds of disposition will be used
before 1974 for replacement ; and
(6) the taxpayer may, within the time
prescribed for the filing of a return of his
income for the taxation year in which the
vessel was disposed of, elect to have the
vessel constituted a prescribed class, or, if
any conversion cost in respect of the vessel
has been included in a separate prescribed
class, have it transferred to that class, and,
if he so elects, the vessel shall be deemed to
have been so transferred immediately before
the disposition thereof but this paragraph
does not apply unless the proceeds of
disposition of the vessel exceed the amount
that would be the undepreciated capital
cost of property of the class to which it
would be so transferred.
(16) Where a vessel owned by a taxpayer is
disposed of by him, he may, if subsection (15)
does not apply to the proceeds of disposition
or if the taxpayer does not make an election
under paragraph (15)(6), within the time
prescribed for the filing of a return of his

been constituted either under this Act or the
Canadian Vessel Construction Assistance Act,
chapter 43 of the Revised Statutes of Canada,
1952, by virtue of the conversion of a vessel
owned by a taxpayer and the vessel is disposed
of by him, if no election is made under
paragraph (15)(6), the separate prescribed class
constituted by virtue of the conversion shall
be deemed to have been transferred to the
class in which the vessel was included
immediately before the disposition thereof.

of this Act, where a taxpayer has
  * (_a_) expended an amount as described in
subparagraph (6)(a)(iii), or
(6) made an election under paragraph
(15)(6) with respect to a vessel and the

subsections (6) and (15).
(19) All or any part of a deposit made
under subparagraph (15)(a)(ii) or under the
Canadian Vessel Construction Assistance Act,
chapter 43 of the Revised Statutes of Canada,

ratio of the amount paid out to the amount
of the deposit shall not exceed the ratio of
the capital cost to him of the vessel or the
conversion cost to him of the vessel, as the
case may be, to the proceeds of disposition of
the vessel disposed of; and any deposit or
part of a deposit not so paid out before 1974
or not paid out pursuant to subsection (20)

Commonwealth Merchant Shipping Agree
ment applies,
the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce
may refund to the taxpayer the deposit, or
the part thereof not paid out to the taxpayer
under subsection (19), as the case may be, in
which case there shall be added, in computing
the income of the taxpayer for the taxation
year of the taxpayer in which the vessel was
disposed of, that proportion of the amount
that would have been included in computing
his income by virtue of subsection (1) had the
deposit not been made under subparagraph
(15)(a)(ii), that the portion of the proceeds of
disposition not so used before 1974 as such a
replacement is of the proceeds of disposition;

this Act such re-assessments of tax, interest or
penalties shall be made as are necessary to
give effect to this subsection. R.S., c. 148, s.

an individual, there would otherwise be
included in computing the income of the
taxpayer for a taxation year from one or more
businesses, partnerships or employments
referred to in subsection (2), income therefrom
for each of two or more earnings periods
ending in the year, and the aggregate of the
number of days in the earnings periods is
greater than the number of days in the
taxation year, the following rules are, if the
taxpayer so elects, applicable:
  * (_a_) the taxpayer s income from such one or
more businesses, partnerships or employ
ments for the taxation year shall be deemed,
for the purposes of this Part, to be that
proportion of the aggregate of the incomes
therefrom that the number of days in the

number of days in the earnings periods,
and
(6) the taxpayer shall pay in addition to
any other tax payable for the year a tax on
the amount by which the aggregate of the
incomes from such one or more businesses,
partnerships or employments for the taxa

the proportion thereof that the tax comput
ed under section 36 for the year on the
assumption that his income from such one
or more businesses, partnerships or employ
ments for the year is the amount determined
under paragraph (a), is of his taxable
income for the year computed on the same
assumption;
but where a taxpayer elects to have those
rules applicable for a taxation year, no
amount is deductible under paragraph 30(1)(/)
in computing his taxable income for the year.
(4) An election by a taxpayer to have the
rules referred to in subsection (1) applicable
for a taxation year is not valid if the taxpayer
may elect to have the rules referred to in
subsection (3) applicable for the year.
(5) An election by a taxpayer to have the
referred to in subsection (3) applicable
for a taxation year is not valid if the taxpayer

year of averaging and no further deduction
may be made therefrom under any other
provision of this Part.

computation of a taxpayer s tax for a taxation
year and the aggregate of the taxes payable
under this Part for the preceding years exceeds

the assessment of tax, interest and penalties
apply mutatis mutandis to an assessment

s. 13.

**59.** (1) Where a person has, on or after

so transferred or from property substituted
therefor; and

transferor was so liable to pay equal to
the value of the property so transferred ;
but nothing in this subsection shall be deemed
to limit the liability of the transferor under
any other provision of this Act.
(2) The Minister may at any time assess a
transferee in respect of any amount payable
by virtue of this section and the provisions of

of his liability shall to the extent thereof
discharge the joint liability; but
(6) a payment by the transferor on account
of his liability only discharges the trans
feree s liability to the extent that the
payment operates to reduce the transferor s
liability to an amount less than the amount
in respect of which the transferee was, by
subsection (1), made jointly and severally
liable. R.S., c. 148, s. 53.
Interest

**60.** (1) Where the amount paid on account

return of income to the day of payment at
the rate of 6% per annum.

of the amount he failed to pay, pay interest
at 6% per annum from the day on or before
which he was required to make the payment
to the day of payment or the beginning of
the period in respect of which he becomes
liable to pay interest thereon under subsection
(1), whichever is earlier.
(3) In addition to the interest payable
under subsection (1), where a corporation that
paid tax under subsection 56(2) had a taxable
income for the taxation year of more than
$10,000, it shall, forthwith after assessment,
pay an amount equal to 3% of the tax payable
under this Part for the taxation year.
(4) For the purposes of subsection (2), where
a taxpayer is required to pay a part or
instalment of tax for a taxation year as
estimated by him on his taxable income for a
preceding year or on his estimated taxable
income for the taxation year, he shall be
deemed to have been liable to pay a part or
instalment computed by reference to the
taxable income for
  * (_a_) the preceding year, or
  * (_b_) the taxation year,
is the lesser.
(5) Notwitstanding any other provision in
this section, no interest is payable in respect
of the amount by which the tax payable by a
person is increased by a payment made by
The Canadian Wheat Board on a participation
certificate previously issued to him until 30
days after the payment is made.
  * (_g_) Where the income of a taxpayer for a
taxation year, or part thereof, is from sources
in another country and the taxpayer by
reason of monetary or exchange restrictions
imposed by the law of that country is unable
to transfer it to Canada, the Minister may, if
he is satisfied that payment as required by
this Part of the whole of the additional tax
under this Part for the year reasonably
attributable to income from sources in that
country would impose extreme hardship on
the taxpayer, postpone the time for payment
of the whole or a part of that additional tax
for a period to be determined by the Minister
but no such postponement may be granted if
any of the income for the year from sources
in that country has been
  * (_a_) transferred to Canada,
(6) used by the taxpayer for any purpose
whatever, other than payment of income
tax to the government of that other country
on income from sources therein, or
  * (_c_) disposed of by him ;
and no interest is payable under this section
in respect of that additional tax, or part
thereof, during the period of postponement.

under section 30 in computing his taxable
income for a taxation year an amount in
respect of a loss sustained in the taxation
year immediately following the taxation year
(hereinafter in this subsection referred to as
"the loss year"), for the purpose of computing
interest under subsection (1) or (2) on tax or a
part or instalment of tax for the taxation year
for any portion of the period in respect of
the interest is payable on or before the
last day of the loss year, the tax payable for
the taxation year shall be deemed to be the
amount that it would have been if the
taxpayer were not entitled to deduct any
amount under section 30 in respect of that
loss. R.S., c. 148, s. 54; 1953-54, c. 57, s. 12;

Part that was unpaid at that time was less

Part but, whether he is taxable or not, not
less than $25 or more than $100, or

lesser amount as the Minister may have
fixed in respect of the specific failure. U.S.,
c. 148, s. 55.

or sought to be evaded.

amounting to gross negligence
in the carrying out of any duty or obligation
imposed by or under this Act, has made, or
has participated in, assented to or acquiesced
in the making of, a statement or omission in
a return, certificate, statement or answer filed
or made as required by or under this Act or a
regulation, as a result of which the tax that
would have been payable by him for a
taxation year if the tax had been assessed on
the basis of the information provided in the
return, certificate, statement or answer is less
than the tax payable by him for the year, is
liable to a penalty of 25% of the amount by
which the tax that would so have been payable
is less than the tax payable by him for the
year.
(3) Where a person is liable to a penalty
under subsection (2) in respect of any
statement or omission in a return, certificate,
statement or answer filed or made as required
by or under this Act or a regulation, he is not

Refund of Overpayment

**63.** (1) If the return of a taxpayer s income
for a taxation year has been made within four
years from the end of the year, the Minister
  * (_a_) may, upon mailing the notice of
assessment for the year, refund, without
application therefor, any overpayment
made on account of the tax, and
(6) shall make such a refund after mailing
the notice of assessment if application
therefor has been made in writing by the
taxpayer within 4 years from the end of the
year.
(2) Instead of making a refund that might
otherwise be made under this section, the
Minister may, where the taxpayer is liable or
about to become liable to make another
payment under this Act, apply the amount of
the overpayment to that other liability and
notify the taxpayer of that action.
(3) Where an amount in respect of an
overpayment is refunded, or applied under
this section on other liability, interest at the
rate of 3% per annum shall be paid or applied
thereon for the period commencing with the
latest of
  * (_a_) the day when the overpayment arose,
(6) the day on or before which the return
of the income in respect of which the tax
was paid was required to be filed, and
  * (_c_) the day when the return of income was
actually filed,
and ending with the day of refunding or
application aforesaid, unless the amount of
the interest so calculated is less than $1, in
which event no interest shall be paid or
applied under this subsection.

under section 64 or by a decision of the Tax
Appeal Board, the Exchequer Court of
Canada or the Supreme Court of Canada, it
is finally determined that the tax payable by
a taxpayer for a taxation year under this Part
is less than the amount assessed by the
assessment under section 51 to which the
objection was made or from which the appeal
was taken and the decision makes it appear
that there has been an overpayment for the
taxation year, the interest payable under
subsection (3) on that overpayment shall be
computed at 6% instead of 3%.
(5) For the purpose of this section
"overpayment" means the aggregate of all
amounts paid on account of tax minus all
amounts payable under this Act or an amount
so paid where no amount is so payable.
(6) Where a taxpayer is entitled to deduct
under section 30 in computing his taxable
income for a taxation year an amount in
respect of a loss sustained in the taxation
year immediately following the taxation year
(hereinafter in this subsection referred to as
"the loss year") and the amount of the tax
payable for the taxation year is relevant in
determining an overpayment for the purpose
computing interest under subsection (3) for
portion of a period ending on or before
last day of the loss year, the tax payable
the taxation year shall be deemed to be
the amount that it would have been if the
taxpayer were not entitled to deduct any
amount under section 30 in respect of that
loss. R.S., c. 148, s. 57; 1952-53, c. 40, s. 65;

heir or other legal representative having
ownership or control of the trust or estate
property.
(2) A trust or estate shall, for the purposes
this Act, and without affecting the liability
the trustee or legal representative for his
income tax, be deemed to be in respect
the trust or estate property an individual ;
where there is more than one trust and
  * (_a_) substantially all of the property of the
various trusts has been received from one
person, and
(6) the various trusts are conditioned so
that the income thereof accrues or will
ultimately accrue to the same beneficiary,
or group or class of beneficiaries,

section 29 or paragraph 30(l)(d) from the
income of a trust or estate.
(4) For the purposes of this Part, there may

year to a beneficiary or other person benefi
cially interested therein or was included in
the income of a beneficiary for the year by
virtue of subsection 72(2).
(5) No deduction may be made under
subsection (4) in computing the income for a
taxation year of a trust or estate in respect of
such part of an amount that would otherwise
be its income for the year as was payable in
the year to a person who, at the time such
part of that amount became so payable, was
not resident in Canada, unless, at that time,
the trust or estate was resident in Canada.
(6) No deduction may be made under
subsection (4) in computing the income for a
taxation year of a trust or estate, other than
a trust or estate that arose upon the death of
the individual creating the trust or estate,
that has income for the year from a business
carried on by it in Canada, in respect of such
part of an amount that would otherwise be
income for the year as was payable in the
to a person who, at the time the amount
so payable, was
  * (_a_) a non-resident person;
(6) a non-resident-owned investment corpo
ration ; or
  * (_c_) a trust or estate resident in Canada
other than
  * (_i_) a trust or estate that arose upon the
death of the individual creating the trust
or estate, or
  * (_ii_) a trust or estate that throughout the
period commencing on April 26, 1965 and
ending at the time the amount became so
payable, was a beneficiary of or other
person beneficially interested in the trust
or estate by whom the amount became so
payable, which latter-mentioned trust or
estate was throughout such period carry
ing on a business in Canada.
(7) Where all the property of a trust is
owned by the trustee for the benefit of non
resident persons or their unborn issue, in
addition to the amount that may be deducted
under subsection (4), there may be deducted
in computing the income of the trust for a
taxation year for the purposes of this Part,
such part of the dividends and interest
received by the trust in a year from a non
resident-owned investment corporation as is
not deductible under subsection (4) in com
puting the income of the trust for the year.
(8) Such part of the amount that would be
the income of a trust or estate for a taxation
year if no deduction were made under
subsection (4) or under regulations made
under paragraph ll(l)(a) as was payable in
the year to a beneficiary or other person
beneficially interested therein shall be includ
ed in computing the income of the person to
whom it so became payable whether or not it
was paid to him in that year and shall not be
included in computing his income for a
subsequent year in which it was paid.
(9) For the purposes of subsections (4), (5),
and (8), an amount shall not be considered
to be payable in a taxation year unless it was
paid in the year to the person to whom it was
payable or he was entitled in that year to
enforce payment thereof.
(10) A beneficiary or other person benefi
cially interested in a trust or estate may
deduct from the amount that would otherwise

amount that would otherwise be deductible
from the income of the trust or estate for the
year under regulations made under paragraph
ll(l)(a) as the trust or estate may determine;
and any amount deductible under this section
for a taxation year shall be deducted from
the amount that the trust or estate would
otherwise be able to deduct under regulations
made under the said paragraph (a) but shall,
for the purpose of section 22, be deemed to
have been allowed to the trust or estate under
those regulations in computing its income for
the year.
(11) Where an amount is payable in a
taxation year by a trust or estate to a
beneficiary or other person beneficially inter
ested therein, no part thereof shall be deemed,

computing the income of the trust or estate
for the year under regulations made under
paragraph ll(l)(a.l) or under subsection 11(2)
except such part thereof as the trust or estate
designates as being so payable.
(j2) Where the income of a trust or estate
for a taxation year or any part thereof was
not payable in the year but was held in trust
for an infant or minor whose right thereto
had vested and the only reason that it was
not payable in the year was that the
beneficiary or other person beneficially enti
tled was an infant or minor, it shall, for the
purpose of subsections (4) and (8), be consid
ered to have been payable to him in the year.
(13) Where the income of a trust or estate
a taxation year (before making any
deduction under subsection (4)) includes rental
income from real property (hereinafter in this
referred to as "rental income") and
there is allocated by the trust or estate for the
purposes of this subsection an amount for the
year to one or more of the beneficiaries or
other persons beneficially interested in the
trust or estate, which amount or the aggregate
of which amounts does not exceed the rental
income of the trust or estate, the following
rules apply :
  * (_a_) each of the beneficiaries or other persons
beneficially interested in the trust or estate
shall, for the purposes of section 36, be
deemed to have received from the trust or
estate an amount for the year as rental
income equal to the lesser of
  * (_i_) the amount, if any, included in
computing his income for the year by
virtue of subsection (8), and
  * (_ii_) the amount, if any, so allocated to
him ; and
(6) the rental income of the trust or estate
for the year shall be deemed to be the
rental income otherwise determined, minus
the amount or the aggregate of the amounts,
as the case may be, so allocated to each of
the beneficiaries or other persons benefi
cially interested in the trust or estate.
(14) That proportion of the amount includ
ed in computing the income for a taxation
year of a beneficiary or other person benefi
cially interested in a trust or estate by virtue
of subsection (8) that

taxation year (before making any deduction
under subsection (4)) from shares of the
capital stock of taxable corporations, includ
ing all amounts that it is, by subsection
8(3), deemed to have received in the year
as dividends, and the amount by which its
income for the year was increased by the
operation of section 97,
is of
(6) the income of the trust or estate for the
taxation year (before making any deduction
under subsection (4)),
shall be deemed, for the purposes of section
41 and this subsection, to be a dividend in
of shares of the capital stock of a
taxable corporation ; and in computing the
deduction that a trust or estate may make
from its tax for the year under section 41, the
same proportion of its income for the year
(after making the deduction therefrom per
mitted by subsection (4)) shall be deemed to
be such a dividend.
(15) For the purpose of section 44, the
following rules apply :
  * (_a_) that proportion of an amount included
in computing the income for a taxation
year of a beneficiary or other person
beneficially interested in a trust or estate
by virtue of subsection (8) that

the taxation year from sources in a
foreign country (before making any
deduction under subsection (4)),
is of
  * (_ii_) the income of the trust or estate for
the taxation year (before making any
deduction under subsection (4)),
shall be deemed to have been income for
the taxation year from sources in that
country unless the trust or estate has, in a
prescribed form filed with the Minister,
designated how much of the income of the
trust or estate for the year from sources in
that country (before making any deduction
under subsection (4)) may be regarded as
having been payable in the year to each of
the respective beneficiaries or other persons
beneficially interested in the estate, in
which event, of the amount included in
computing the income for the year of each
beneficiary or other such person by virtue
of subsection (8), the amount so designated
for him shall be deemed to have been
income for the taxation year from sources
in that country;
(6) a beneficiary or other person beneficially
interested in a trust or estate shall be
deemed to have paid as income tax for a
taxation year, on the income that he is
deemed by paragraph (a) to have for the
year from sources in a foreign country, to
the government of that country an amount
equal to that proportion of the income or
profits tax paid to that government by the
trust or estate for the year that
  * (_i_) that portion of the amount included
in computing his income for the year by
virtue of subsection (8) that is, by
paragraph (a), deemed to have been
income for the year from sources in that
country,
is of
  * (_ii_) the income of the trust or estate for
the year from sources in that country
(before making any deduction under
subsection (4)) ;
  * (_c_) the income of a trust or estate from
sources in a foreign country for a taxation
year shall be deemed to be its actual income
therefrom for the year minus the aggregate
of the amounts deemed by paragraph (a) to
have been the income therefrom for the
year of all beneficiaries and other such
persons ;
  * (_d_) a trust or estate shall be deemed to have
paid as income tax to the government of a
country other than Canada for a taxation
year an amount equal to the income or
profits tax actually paid by it to the
government of that country for the year
minus the aggregate of the amounts deemed
by paragraph (6) to have been paid to that
government for the year by beneficiaries
and other such persons.

on death, notwithstanding the other provisions
of this Act,

means the period for which the accounts of
the trust or estate have been ordinarily
made up and accepted for purposes of
assessment under this Act and, in the
absence of an established practice, the
period adopted by the trust or estate for
that purpose, (but no period may exceed 12
months and a change in a usual and
accepted period may not be made for the
purpose of this Act without the concurrence
of the Minister);
(6) when a taxation year is referred to by
reference to any calendar year, the reference
is to the taxation year or years coinciding
with, or ending in, that year;
  * (_c_) the income of a person from the trust or
estate for a taxation year shall be deemed
to be his benefits from or under the trust or
estate for the taxation year or years of the
trust or estate that ended in the year
determined as provided by this section and
section 72 ;
  * (_d_) where an individual having income
from the trust or estate died after the end
of a taxation year of the trust or estate but
before the end of the calendar year in which
that taxation year ended, a separate return
of his income from the trust or estate after
the end of the trust s or estate s taxation
year to the time of death shall be filed and
the tax under this Part shall be paid thereon
as if that income were the income of another
person ; and
  * (_e_) in lieu of making the payments required
by section 55, the trust or estate shall pay
to the Receiver General within 90 days

have been required to file under this Part
if the taxpayer had been resident in Canada
during that year, and

this Act, not to be a deferred profit sharing
plan, and notwithstanding any other provision
of this Act, the following rules shall apply:

under this Part upon the taxable income of
the trust for a taxation year in which, at
any time therein, the trust was governed by

sharing plan at the time he received those
amounts, and
  * (_ii_) the amount or value of any funds or
property appropriated to or for the
benefit of the taxpayer in the year that,
by virtue of subsection (13), would have
been so included if the revoked plan had

time of the appropriation of the funds or
property; and

the purposes of this Act, not to be an
employees profit sharing plan.

under which an employer makes payments to
a trustee specifically provide that the pay
ments shall be made "out of profits", such
arrangement shall be deemed, for the purpose
of subsection (1), to be an arrangement for
payments "computed by reference to his
profits from his business".
(17) Where the expression "employee or
other beneficiary" under a profit sharing plan
occurs in this section, the words "other
beneficiary" shall be construed as meaning

amount received by the taxpayer from a
trustee under the plan as if the taxpayer
were a beneficiary under the plan, and

**95.** (1) There shall be included in comput
ing the income for a taxation year of a
policyholder,
  * (_a_) in respect of any life insurance policy
other than an annuity contract, the amount,
if any, by which the proceeds of the
disposition of an interest in the policy that
he became entitled to receive in the year
exceeds the adjusted cost basis of the policy
to the policyholder as of the time of the
disposition ; and
(6) in respect of any life insurance policy
(other than a policy that is a registered
retirement savings plan or that is or is
issued pursuant to a registered pension fund
or plan) all or any part of the insurer s
reserves for which vary in amount depending
upon the fair market value of a specified
group of assets (in this section referred to
as a "segregated fund"), such portion of
any amount allocated to the policyholder
in the year under the policy as was allocated
out of gross revenue of the insurer from the
segregated fund.
(2) For the purposes of subsection (1) and
the definition "adjusted cost basis" in subsec
tion (10), where at a particular time a
policyholder became entitled to receive under
a life insurance policy an amount as, on
account or in lieu of payment of, or in
satisfaction of, a policy dividend, the policy-
holder shall be deemed to have disposed of
an interest in the policy at that time and that
amount shall be deemed to be proceeds of the
disposition that he became entitled to receive
at that time.
(3) For the purposes of this section, where
l or any part of an insurer s reserves for a
insurance policy vary in amount depend
upon the fair market value of a segregated
  * (_a_) in computing the adjusted cost basis of
the policy,
  * (_i_) an amount paid by the policyholder
or on his behalf as or on account of
premiums under the policy or to acquire
an interest in the policy shall, to the
extent that such amount was used by the
insurer to acquire property for the
purposes of the segregated fund, be
deemed not to have been so paid, and
  * (_ii_) any transfer of property by the insurer
from the segregated fund that resulted in
an increase in the portion of its reserves
for the policy that do not vary with the
fair market value of the fund shall be
deemed to have been a premium paid
under the policy by the policyholder;
(6) the proceeds of the disposition of an
interest in the policy shall be deemed not
to include the portion thereof, if any,
payable out of the segregated fund ; and
  * (_c_) any transfer of property by the insurer
to the segregated fund that resulted in an
increase in the portion of the insurer s
reserves for the policy that vary with the
fair market value of the segregated fund
and in a decrease in the portion of its
reserves for the policy that do not so vary,
shall be deemed to be a disposition of an
interest in the policy entitling the policy-
holder to receive proceeds of disposition
equal to the amount of the increase.
(4) That proportion of any policyholder
allocation from a segregated fund made to a
policyholder by an insurer at any time in its
taxation year that

revenue for the year from the fund as was
dividends received by it in the year from
taxable corporations
is of

from the fund
for the purposes of section 41, be deemed
to be a dividend received by the policyholder
a taxable corporation in respect of shares
the capital stock thereof.
  * (_a_) that proportion of any policyholder
allocation from a segregated fund made by
an insurer to a policyholder at any time in
its taxation year that
  * (_i_) such portion of the insurer s gross
revenue for the year from the fund as
was dividends or interest payments
received by it in the year from a non
resident person
is of
  * (_ii_) the insurer s gross revenue for the
year from the fund
shall be deemed to be income of the
policyholder from sources in a country other
than Canada ; and
(6) the policyholder shall be deemed to
have paid as income tax to the government
of that other country, on the amount
deemed by paragraph (a) to be his income
from sources in that other country, an
amount equal to that proportion of the
allocation that
  * (_i_) the aggregate of taxes paid by the
insurer to the governments of countries
other than Canada for the year in respect
of the dividends and interest payments
so received by it (to the extent that such
taxes were deducted in calculating, for
the purposes of the relevant authority,
the amount of the fund as of the end of
the year)
is of
  * (_ii_) the insurer s gross revenue for the
year from the fund.
(6) Such part of the amount that, but for
this subsection, would be deductible under
subsection 11(2) in computing an insurer s
income for a taxation year from shares of a
corporation that were included in a segregated
fund of the insurer as is equal to that
proportion of any policyholder allocation
from the fund made to a policyholder by the
insurer at any time in the year that
  * (_a_) the amount that, but for this subsection,
would be so deductible under subsection
11(2)
is of
from the fund
notwithstanding that subsection, not
under that subsection in computing
insurer s income for the year but may be
in computing the policyholder s
income for his taxation year in which the
allocation was made.
(7) Where, under the terms of a life
insurance policy other than an annuity
contract, a policyholder became entitled to
receive from the insurer at a particular time
before the death of the person whose life was
insured thereunder, all of the proceeds (other
than policy dividends) payable at that time
under the policy in the form of an annuity
contract or annuity payments,
  * (_a_) the payments shall be regarded as
annuity payments made under an annuity
contract ;
(6) the purchase price of the annuity
contract shall be deemed to be the adjusted
cost basis of the policy to the policyholder
immediately before the first payment under
that contract became payable ; and
  * (_c_) the annuity contract or annuity pay
ments shall be deemed not to be proceeds
of the disposition of an interest in the
policy.

i-t i- 1,1 .,
a " e Ins urance policy other than an annuity
contract is disposed of by way of gift (whether
during his lifetime or by his will), by
distribution from a corporation or by operation
of law only to any person, or in any manner
whatever to any person with whom the
policyholder was not dealing at arm s length,
the policyholder shall be deemed thereupon
to become entitled to receive proceeds of the
disposition equal to the value of the interest
at the time of the disposition, and the person
who acquires the interest by virtue of the
disposition shall be deemed to acquire it at a
cost equal to such value.
(9) Where
  * (_a_) a policyholder owned an interest in a
life insurance policy on October 22, 1968
and has not disposed of it on or before the
policy s tax anniversary date, and
  * (_b_) the value of the interest on the policy s
tax anniversary date (computed without
regard to any premium that became payable
on that date) exceeds the adjusted cost basis
of the policy as of that date (computed
without reference to this subsection and
without regard to any premium that became
payable on that date, but after deducting
all policy dividends that became payable
on that date),
the policyholder shall, for the purposes of the
definition "adjusted cost basis" in subsection
(10), be deemed
  * (_c_) to have acquired the interest on the
policy s tax anniversary date at a cost equal
to its value referred to in paragraph (6),
  * (_d_) to have not, on or before that date, been
entitled to receive any proceeds of disposi
tion of an interest in the policy, and
  * (_e_) to have not, before that date, paid or
had paid on his behalf any amount as or
on account of premiums payable under the
policy.

a particular time of an interest in a life
insurance policy means the amount, if any,
by which
  * (_a_) the aggregate of the cost to him of
acquiring all his interests in the policy and
all amounts paid by him or on his behalf
before that time as or on account of

be included in computing his income for a
taxation year by virtue of paragraph (l)(a) ;

taxation year shall be deemed to be the tax
computed under section 42 for the year.

of a group of corporations that have filed
with the Minister for a taxation year an
agreement under subsection 42(3) or one of a

computed under subsection 42(3) or (4), as the
case may be, the amount determined by
applying subsection (3) of this section mutatis
mutandis and, for that purpose, there shall be
substituted for the amount of $35,000 where
it appears in paragraphs (3)(6) and (c) the

under the agreement, a benefit equal to the
amount by which the value of the shares at

otherwise disposed of rights under the
agreement in respect of some or all of the
shares to a person with whom he was dealing

equal to the value of the consideration for
the disposition shall be deemed to have
been received by the employee by virtue of
his employment in the taxation year in
which that person made the disposition.
(2) Where a benefit is deemed by paragraph
(l)(a),(6),(c) or (d) to have been received by an
employee by virtue of his employment in a
taxation year, the employee shall, if he so
elects, pay as tax for the year under this Part,
in lieu of the amount that would otherwise
be payable, an amount equal to the aggregate
of
  * (_a_) the tax that would be payable by the
employee for the year under this Part if no
benefit were so deemed to have been
received by him in the year, and
  * (_b_) the amount, if any, by which
  * (_i_) the proportion of the benefit so
deemed to have been received that the
aggregate of the taxes that would have
been payable by the employee under this
Part for the 3 years immediately preced
ing the taxation year (before making any
deduction under section 37, 41 or 44), if
no benefit were deemed by paragraph
(l)(a),(6),(c) or (d) to have been received
by him in those years, is of the aggregate
of the employee s income for those years

under subsection (2) to pay as tax for a year
under this Part an amount determined under
that subsection was not resident in Canada

aggregate of
  * (_a_) the tax that would be payable by the
employee for the year under this Part if no
benefit were deemed by paragraph (l)(a),
(6),(c) or (d) to have been received by him
in the year, and
  * (_b_) the amount, if any, by which
  * (_i_) the proportion of the benefit so
deemed to have been received that the
aggregate of the taxes that would have
been payable by the employee under this
Part for the 3 years referred to in
subsection (2) (before making any deduc
tion under section 37, 41 or 44), if he had
been resident in Canada throughout those
years and his incomes for those years had
been from sources in Canada, and if no
benefit were deemed by paragraph (l)(o),
(6),(c) or (d) to have been received by him
in those years, is of the aggregate of the

purpose of this Part except as provided by
this section, and

not been conferred on the employee by the
sale or issue of the shares to him or to a
person in whom his rights under the
agreement have become vested.
(6) For greater certainty it is hereby
declared that, where a person to whom any
provision in subsection (1) would otherwise
apply has ceased to be an employee before
all things have happened that would make
that provision applicable, subsection (1)
continues to apply as though the person were
still an employee and as though the employ-
ment were still in existence.

received in respect of, in the course of or by
virtue of the employment.

has agreed to sell or issue shares to the
employee, and
  * (_b_) subsection (4) does not apply in respect
of shares held by the trustee under the
arrangement. 1952-53, c. 40, s. 73; 1953-54,

shall, upon application in writing made within
two years from the end of the calendar year
in which the amount was paid, pay to him
the amount so paid or such part thereof as he
was not liable to pay, unless he is otherwise
liable or about to become liable to make a
payment under this Act, in which case the
Minister may apply the amount otherwise
payable under this subsection to that payment
and notify him of that fact.
(7) Where, upon application by or on behalf
of a person to the Minister pursuant to
subsection (6) in respect of an amount paid to
the Receiver General that was deducted or
withheld under Part X, the Minister is not
satisfied

any tax under that Part, or
  * (_b_) that the amount paid to the Receiver
General was in excess of the tax that the
person was liable to pay
the Minister shall assess that person for any

pay
  * (_a_) an amount deducted or withheld as

required to pay,

or $10, whichever is the greater, in addition
to the amount itself, together with interest on
the amount at the rate of 10% per annum.
(10) The Minister may assess any person
for any amount payable by that person under
Part X, this section or section 190 and, upon
his sending a notice of assessment to that
person, Division F of Part I is applicable
mutatis mutandis.
(11) Provisions of this Act requiring a
person to deduct or withhold an amount in
respect of taxes from amounts payable to a
taxpayer are applicable to Her Majesty in
right of Canada or a province.
(12) Where this Act requires an amount to
be deducted or withheld, an agreement by the
person on whom that obligation is imposed
not to deduct or withhold is void.
(13) The receipt of the Minister for an
amount withheld or deducted by any person
as required by or under this Act is a good and
sufficient discharge of the liability of any
debtor to his creditor with respect thereto to
the extent of the amount referred to in the
receipt. R.S., c. 148, s. 123; 1952-53, c. 40, s.

more such Acts, such part of that payment
as is applied by the Minister in accordance
with the provisions of a collection agreement
entered into under Part III of the Federal-
Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act against the
tax payable by a taxpayer for a taxation year
under this Act discharges the liability of the
taxpayer for such tax only to the extent of
the part of the payment so applied, notwith
standing that the taxpayer directed that the
payment be applied in a manner other than
that provided in the collection agreement or
made no direction as to its application. 1962-
63, c. 8, s. 25.

intention to avoid or evade taxes under this

or reduced its capital stock, or
  * (_ii_) converted any of its shares into shares
of another class or into an obligation of
the corporation, or

effected after June 13, 1963 or as part of a
series of transactions each of which was or is
a corporation in such a manner that the

corporations in a taxation year is not solely
for the purpose of carrying out the business
of those corporations in the most effective
manner, and
(6) that one of the main reasons for such
separate existence in the year is to reduce
the amount of taxes that would otherwise
be payable under this Act
the two or more corporations shall, if the
Minister so directs, be deemed to be associated
with each other in the year.
(3) On an appeal from an assessment made
pursuant to a direction under this section, the

subsection (1), it determines that none of
the purposes of the transaction or series

that might otherwise have been or become
payable under this Act in consequence of
any distribution of income of a corpora
tion has been or will be avoided ; or
  * (_ii_) in the case of a direction under
subsection (2), it determines that none of
