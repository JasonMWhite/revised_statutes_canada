## GRANTS OF PUBLIC LANDS

**3.** Where under the laws of a province an
instrument transferring land without words of
limitation operates as an absolute transfer of
all such right and title as the transferor has
therein, a grant of public lands in that
if Her Majesty has power to convey
an estate therein, and if no contrary or
intention is expressed in the grant,
as a conveyance of an estate in fee
or an equivalent estate in those lands,
no words of limitation are used in
grant. R.S., c. 224, s. 3.

**4.** (1) The Governor in Council may
  * (_a_) authorize the sale, lease or other
disposition of any public lands that are not
required for public purposes and for the
sale, lease or other disposition of which
there is no other provision in the law ;
(6) make regulations authorizing the Min
ister having the control, management and
administration of any such public lands to
sell, lease or otherwise dispose of them,
subject to such limitations and conditions
as the Governor in Council may prescribe ;
  * (_c_) prescribe a tariff of fees for copies of
maps, plans, field notes, documents, papers
and other records pertaining to public lands,
for the preparation of documents evidencing
a sale, lease or other disposition of public
lands and for the registration in any
government department of any documents
pertaining to public lands; and
  * (_d_) fix the rate of interest to be paid for or
on account of the purchase money or rent
of any public lands sold or leased under
this Act.
(2) The Governor in Council may by order
transfer to Her Majesty in any right other

of the entire or any lesser interest of Her
Majesty in right of Canada in any public
lands not required for public purposes, either
forever or for any lesser term, and subject to

## DEFENCE LANDS

**7.** Such of the lands mentioned in the
schedule to the Ordnance and Admiralty Lands
Act, chapter 115 of the Revised Statutes of
Canada, 1927, as on the 1st day of June 1950
were vested in Her Majesty in right of
Canada, by whatever mode of conveyance
they were acquired or taken, whether in fee,
for life, for years or otherwise, and all the
appurtenances thereof, are and continue
absolutely vested in Her Majesty for the
purposes of Canada in the same manner and
to the same extent as on the 1st day of June

**1950.** R.S., c. 224, s. 7.

**8.** (1) Public lands that are declared by the
Governor in Council to be necessary for the
defence of Canada shall not be sold, alienated
or otherwise disposed of but may be leased or
otherwise used as the Governor in Council
thinks best for the advantage of Canada.
(2) Until the Governor in Council otherwise
provides, lands that on the 1st day of June
1950 were lands in class one under the
Ordnance and Admiralty Lands Act are deemed
to have been declared by the Governor in
Council to be necessary for the defence of
Canada. R.S., c. 224, s. 8.

## CORRECTION OF GRANTS

**9.** A grant that is issued to or in the name
of a person who is dead is not therefore void,
but the title to the land thereby granted or
intended to be granted vests in the heirs,
assigns, devisees or other legal representatives
of the deceased person according to the laws
in force in the province in which the land is
situated, as if the grant had issued to or in
the name of the deceased person during his
lifetime. R.S., c. 224, s. 9.

**10.** Where a grant has issued to, or in the
name of, a wrong person, or contains a clerical
error, misnomer or wrong or defective descrip
of the land thereby intended to be
granted, or where there is in a grant an
omission of the conditions of the grant, the
Governor in Council may, if there is no
adverse claim, direct the defective grant to be
cancelled and a correct grant to be issued in
lieu thereof, and the correct grant relates back
to the date of the grant so cancelled and has
the same force and effect as if issued at the
date of the cancelled grant. R.S., c. 224, s. 10.
1 1. Where through error grants have issued
for the same land, inconsistent with each
other, or where sales or appropriations of the
same land, inconsistent with each other, have
been made, the Governor in Council may
  * (_a_) order a new grant to the person thereby
deprived, of land to a value equal to that
of the original grant at the time of the
grant ;
  * (_b_) in the case of a sale, lease or licence,
order a refund to be made of any money
paid on account of the sale, lease or licence,
with interest at the rate of five per cent per
annum ; or
  * (_c_) when the land has passed from the
original holder, or has been improved before
the discovery of the error, or when the
original grant was a free grant, grant to the
original holder such land as to the Governor
in Council seems just and equitable under
the circumstances ;
but no claim under this section shall be
entertained unless it is made within one year
after the discovery of the error. R.S., c. 224, s.

**11.**
