**2.** Where as a result of the interruption of
normal postal services that occurred between
the 22nd day of July and the 7th day of
August 1965 or where as a result of any
subsequent interruption of normal postal
services in Canada of more than forty-eight
hours duration however caused, a person has
suffered loss or hardship by reason of his
failure to comply with any time requirement
or period of limitation contained in any law
of Canada, he may, on fourteen days notice
in writing to the Deputy Attorney General of
Canada and to any other person who he has
reason to believe may be affected by any
order made pursuant to section 3 as a result
of an application by him under this section,
apply to a judge of the Exchequer Court of
Canada for relief. 1966-67, c. 77, s. 2.

**3.** jf fa e judge to whom an application
under section 2 is made is satisfied
  * (_a_) that the applicant has suffered loss or
hardship as a result of any interruption
described in that section,
  * (_b_) that the applicant took such reasonable
steps as were open to him to comply with
the time requirement or period of limitation
without avail, and
  * (_c_) that the application was made without
undue delay,
judge may, after affording to any person
may be affected by any order made
pursuant to this section as a result of the
application an opportunity to be heard on
the application or to make representations in
connection therewith, and subject to such
conditions, if any, as to him seem just,
  * (_d_) make an order waiving the time require
ment or period of limitation in relation to
the applicant and fixing such other time
requirement or period of limitation in
relation thereto as in his opinion the
circumstances warrant, and
  * (_e_) make such further order as, in his
opinion, is necessary to permit the applicant
effectively to do any thing or exercise any
right that he would have been able to do or
exercise if he had not failed to comply with
the time requirement or period of limitation,
including, where the time requirement or
period of limitation with which the appli
cant failed to comply relates to the
commencement or carrying on of any
proceeding authorized or provided for under
any law of Canada, such order as he
considers necessary to enable the proceeding
to be commenced and continued or to be
carried on as though the applicant had not
failed to comply with that time requirement
or period of limitation. 1966-67, c. 77, s. 3.

**4.** (1) Where the judge to whom an applica
tion under section 2 is made is of the opinion
that public notice of the hearing of the
application should be given in order that it
may be brought to the attention of any person
who may be affected by any order made
pursuant to section 3 as a result of the
application, the judge may, at any time
before disposing of the application, direct the
applicant to give public notice of the hearing
in such form and manner as the judge deems
fit.
(2) Where pursuant to subsection (1) a judge
has directed that public notice of the hearing
of an application be given, the judge may
from time to time thereafter give such further
directions as he considers necessary or desira
ble in order that any person to whose attention
the notice is intended to be brought may be
afforded an opportunity to be heard on the
application or to make representations in
connection therewith. 1966-67, c. 77, s. 4.

**5.** Where in respect of any application
under section 2, any matter or thing is
authorized or required by this Act to be done
or proceeded with by or before a judge of the
Exchequer Court of Canada, the matter or
thing may be done or proceeded with by or
before any other judge of the Court as though
the application were an application to the
Court. 1966-67, c. 77, s. 5.
