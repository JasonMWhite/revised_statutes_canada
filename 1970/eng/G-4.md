in this Act means any obligation incurred
before, on or after the 3rd day of June 1939
(including any such obligation that has, at
any time before, on or after that date, matured
or been repudiated) that purports to give to
the creditor a right to require payment in
gold or in gold coin or in an amount of money
measured thereby, and includes any such
obligation of the Government of Canada or
of any province. R.S., c. 130, s. 2.

**3.** This Act has full force and effect
notwithstanding anything contained in any
other statute or law. R.S., c. 130, s. 3.

clause obligation,
  * (_a_) tender in currency that is legal tender
in the country in the money of which the
obligation is or becomes payable, of the
nominal or face amount of the obligation,
or
  * (_b_) tender in currency that is legal tender
where the tender is made of an amount that
is equivalent to the nominal or face amount
of the obligation,
shall be a legal tender if such tender was
made at the place at which the obligation was
payable by the terms of the contract whether
such tender was made before or after the
commencement of such action, and the debtor
is, if he has made payment in accordance
with such tender, entitled to a discharge of
obligation or of any liability for damages
reason of repudiation of liability upon
obligation. R.S., c. 130, s. 4.

**5.** In an action in Canada upon a foreign
rendered in an action commenced
after the 2nd day of June 1939 upon a gold
clause obligation,
  * (_a_) tender in currency that is legal tender

obligation is or becomes payable, of the
nominal or face amount of such obligation,
or
(6) tender in currency that is legal tender
where the tender is made of an amount that
is equivalent to the nominal or face amount
of such obligation,
shall be a legal tender if such tender was
made at the place at which the obligation was
payable by the terms of the contract and
before the foreign action was commenced, and
the debtor is, if he has made payment in
accordance with such tender, entitled to a
discharge of such judgment. R.S., c. 130, s. 5.

**6.** Any payment in respect of a gold clause
obligation made before the 3rd day of June

incurred before, on or after the 3rd day of
June 1939 that purports to give to the creditor
a right to require payment in gold or in gold
coin, or in an amount of money measured
thereby, is contrary to public policy, and
every obligation containing such a provision
has effect as if such provision were not
contained therein, and as if it contained a
covenant to pay its nominal or face amount
in currency that is legal tender in the country
in the money of which the obligation is
payable, or its equivalent in Canadian
currency. R.S., c. 130, s. 7.

**8.** Every gold clause obligation secured on
or enforceable against any work or undertak
ing subject to the legislative authority of the
Parliament of Canada shall be construed as
if it contained no reference to gold or gold
coin and as if the only amount stipulated to
be paid thereunder were its nominal or face
amount in currency that is legal tender in the
country in the money of which the obligation
is payable, or its equivalent in Canadian
currency. R.S., c. 130, s. 8.

**9.** In respect of any gold clause obligation,
the Exchequer Court of Canada shall not
pronounce or enforce any judgment, order or
decree wherein the amount of the liability is
fixed for any purpose whatever at more than
the nominal or face value of such obligation
in currency that is legal tender in the country
in the money of which such obligation is
payable or its equivalent in Canadian curren
cy. R.S., c. 130, s. 9.

**10.** Sections 4 and 5, section 7, section 8,
and section 9, have effect as though contained
in separate statutes and apply to all obliga
tions wherever payable. R.S., c. 130, s. 10.
