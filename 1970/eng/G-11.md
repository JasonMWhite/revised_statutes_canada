portions of that part of such bridge, erection,
structure or tunnel which is over the railway.
(2) The Minister, before using higher freight
cars than those which admit of such open and
clear headway of at least seven feet, shall,
after having first obtained the consent of the

using higher freight cars than those used on
the railway at the time of such construction,
reconstruction, or large repairs, shall, after
having first obtained the consent of the
municipality or of the owners of such highway
bridge, or other erection or structure, or
tunnel, raise the said tunnel or bridge, or
other erection or structure, and the approaches
thereto, if necessary, so as to admit, as

the strength of an ordinary division fence,
with swing gates or sliding gates, commonly
called hurdle gates, with proper fastenings, at
farm crossings of the railway, for the use of
the proprietors of the lands adjoining the
railway.
(2) The Minister shall also, within the time
aforesaid, construct and thereafter maintain
cattle-guards at all public road crossings,
suitable and sufficient to prevent cattle and
animals from getting on the railway.
(3) In the case of a hurdle gate fifteen
inches longer than the opening, two upright
posts supporting the gate at each end shall be
deemed to be proper fastenings within the
meaning of this section.
(4) Every railway gate at a farm crossing
shall be of sufficient width for the purposes
for which it is intended. R.S., c. 136, s. 24.

s. 27.
INJURIES TO CATTLE

**28.** No horses, sheep, swine or cattle shall

within half a mile of the intersection of such
highway with any railway on grade, unless
such animals are in charge of some person to
prevent their loitering or stopping on such
highway at such intersection. R.S., c. 136,
s. 28.

**29.** All horses, sheep, swine or cattle found
large in violation of section 28 may, by
person finding such animals at large, be
impounded in the pound nearest to the place
they are so found and the pound-
keeper with whom they are so impounded
detain the animals in the like manner,
and subject to the like regulations, as to the
care and disposal thereof, as in the case of
cattle impounded for trespass on private
property. R.S., c. 136, s. 29.

**30.** Where the horses, sheep, swine or cattle
of any person that are at large contrary to
the provisions hereinbefore contained are
killed or injured by any train at such point
of intersection, that person shall not have any

were killed or injured through the negligence
or wilfulness of some officer, employee or
servant of the Minister. R.S., c. 136, s. 30.
3 j. (\) When any horses, sheep, swine or
cattle at large, whether upon the highway or

injured by a train, the owner of any such
animal so killed or injured is, except in the
cases otherwise provided for by section 32,
entitled to recover the amount of such loss or
injury against Her Majesty, unless Her
Majesty establishes that such animal got at
large through the negligence or wilful act or
omission of the owner or his agent, or of the
custodian of such animal or his agent.
(2) The fact that any such animal was not
in charge of some competent person or persons
does not, if the animal was killed or injured
upon the railway, and not at the point of
intersection with the highway, deprive the
owner of his right to recover. R.S., c. 136,
s. 31.

**32.** No person whose horses, cattle, or other
animals are killed or injured by any train has
any right of action or is entitled to compen
sation in respect of such horses, cattle, or
other animals being so killed or injured, if
they were so killed or injured by reason of
any person
  * (_a_) for whose use any farm crossing is
furnished failing to keep the gates at each
side of the railway closed, when not in use ;
(6) wilfully leaving open any gate on either
side of the railway provided for the use of
any farm crossing, without some person
being at or near such gate to prevent
animals from passing through the gate on
to the railway ;
  * (_c_) other than an officer, employee or
servant of Her Majesty while acting in the
discharge of his duty, taking down any part
of a railway fence ;
  * (_d_) turning any such horse, cattle, or other
animal upon or within the enclosure of any
railway, except for the purpose of and while
crossing the railway in charge of some
competent person using all reasonable care
and precaution to avoid accidents ; or
  * (_e_) except as authorized by this Act, without
the consent of Her Majesty, riding, leading
or driving any such horse, cattle, or other
animal, or allowing the animal to enter
upon any railway and within the fences
and guards thereof. R.S., c. 136, s. 32.

system or other device, that, in the opinion
of the Minister, will render it safe to permit
engines and trains to pass over such crossing
without being stopped, the Minister may, by
written order, give permission for engines and
trains to pass without stopping, under such
regulations as to speed and other matters as
the Minister deems proper.
(3) The Minister may at any time modify
or revoke such order. R.S., c. 136, s. 34.

**35.** When a railway passes any draw or
swingbridge over a navigable river, canal or
stream, that is subject to be open for the
purposes of navigation, the trains shall in
every case be stopped at least three minutes
before crossing to ascertain from the bridge
tender that the bridge is closed and in perfect
order for passing. R.S., c. 136, s. 35.

**36.** An employee shall be stationed at each
point on the line crossed on a level by any
other railway, and no train shall proceed over

sustained by any person by reason of any
neglect to comply with this provision.
(3) One-half of such damages shall be
chargeable to and be deducted from any
salary due to the engineer having charge of

registrar of deeds for the county or registration
division in which the lands were situated, but
no description thereof was so deposited, as in
section 7 of the said Act required, the deposit

only of the lands taken was recorded, filed
or deposited as aforesaid, although the Act
under which the lands were taken did not
require any plan or description to be so
recorded, filed or deposited,
the recording, filing or depositing of the plan
and description, or of the plan only, as the

be served with process in such cases.

counterclaim which Her Majesty may have

not been passed and if the action, suit or
other proceeding were instituted and prose
cuted in that court upon petition of right.
