court cannot be found within the jurisdiction
of the juvenile court out of which the warrant
was so issued, but is or is suspected to be in
any other part of Canada, any judge or
deputy judge of a juvenile court within whose
jurisdiction such person is or is suspected to
be, or if there is no juvenile court having
jurisdiction in such place, then any justice
within whose jurisdiction such person is or is
suspected to be, upon proof being made on
oath or affirmation of the handwriting of the
juvenile court judge or other officer who

complying with subsection (3). R.S., c.
160, s. 17.

taken under this Act. R.S., c. 160, s. 18.

juvenile court a child of tender years who is
called as a witness does not, in the opinion of
the judge, understand the nature of an oath,

of the judge the child is possessed of sufficient
intelligence to justify the reception of the
evidence and understands the duty of speaking
the truth.
(2) No person shall be convicted upon the
evidence of a child of tender years not under
oath unless such evidence is corroborated in
some material respect. U.S., c. 160, s. 19.

or other conditions as may be deemed
advisable ;
  * (_h_) commit the child to the charge of any

charge of the superintendent, if there is
one ; or

duly approved by the lieutenant governor
in council.

of the court to make an order upon the parent
or parents of the child, or upon the munici

to the child s support such sum as the court
may determine, and where such order is made
upon the municipality, the municipality may
from time to time recover from the parent or
parents any sum or sums paid by it pursuant
to such order.
(3) Where a child has been adjudged to be
a juvenile delinquent and whether or not such
child has been dealt with in any of the ways
provided for in subsection (1), the court may
at any time, before such juvenile delinquent
has reached the age of twenty-one years and
unless the court has otherwise ordered, cause
by notice, summons, or warrant, the delinquent
to be brought before the court, and the court
may then take any action provided for in
subsection (1), or may make an order with
respect to such child under section 9, or may
discharge the child on parole or release the
child from detention, but in a province in
which there is a superintendent, no child shall
be released by the judge from an industrial
school without a report from such superin
tendent recommending such release, and
where an order is made by a court releasing a
juvenile delinquent from an industrial school
or transferring such delinquent from an
industrial school to a foster home or from one
foster home to another under this subsection,

before the court at the time that such order is

as provided in subsection (3), the court may
with the case on the report of the
officer or other person in whose
such child has been placed, or of the
of a children s aid society, or of the
superintendent, or of the superintendent of
the industrial school to which the child has
been committed, without the necessity of
hearing any further or other evidence.

that which the court is of opinion the child s
own good and the best interests of the
community require. R.S., c. 160, s. 20.

dealt with by the court under this Act.

keen I u ^ t y ^ an offence and the court is of
the opinion that the case would be best met
by the imposition of a fine, damages or costs,
whether with or without restitution or any
other action, the court may, if satisfied that
the parent or guardian has conduced to the
commission of the offence by neglecting to
exercise due care of the child or otherwise,
order that the fine, damages or costs awarded
be paid by the parent or guardian of the
child, instead of by the child.
(2) Where a fine is imposed and ordered to
be paid by the parent or guardian, the limit

such sum or by an order made subsequently,
that the money shall be recoverable by distress
and sale of the goods and chattels of the
party and in default of such distress by
imprisonment, and the amount is so recover

a fine imposed under any provision of the
Criminal Code is recoverable, or is recoverable
as provided in any Act of the legislature of
the province making provision for the recovery
of fines.
(4) No order shall be made under this
section without giving the parent or guardian
an opportunity of being heard ; but a parent
or guardian who has been duly served with
notice of the hearing pursuant to section 10
shall be deemed to have had such opportunity,
notwithstanding the fact that he has failed to
attend the hearing.

of appeal from an order made under this
section as if the order had been made on the
conviction of the parent or guardian.

upon any person found guilty under this
section and suspend sentence subject to those
conditions, and on proof at any time that
those conditions have been violated may pass
sentence on such person.
(4) It is not a valid defence to a prosecution
under this section either that the child is of
too tender years to understand or appreciate
the nature or effect of the conduct of the
accused, or that notwithstanding the conduct
of the accused the child did not in fact become
a juvenile delinquent.
(5) Notwithstanding anything to the con
trary in section 5 or in the provisions of the
Criminal Code referred to in paragraph 5(1)(6),

when a child has unlawfully left the custody
of an institution or foster home knowingly
harbours or conceals such child without notice
of the child s whereabouts to the court or to
the institution or to the local police authori
ties, is guilty of an offence and is liable upon

one hundred dollars or to imprisonment for a
period not exceeding one year, or to both.
R.S., c. 160, s. 34.

**35.** (1) Prosecutions against adults for
offences against any provisions of the Criminal
Code in respect of a child may be brought in
the juvenile court without the necessity of a
preliminary hearing before a justice, and may
be summarily disposed of where the offence
is triable summarily, or otherwise dealt with
as in the case of a preliminary hearing before
a justice.

inconsistent with this Act that would apply
to similar proceedings if brought before a
justice apply to prosecutions brought before
the juvenile court under this section. R.S., c.
160, s. 35.

**36.** (1) Every juvenile court has such and
like powers and authority to preserve order in

and by the judges thereof, during the sittings
thereof.
(2) Every judge of a juvenile court, when
ever any resistance is offered to the execution
of any summons, warrant of execution or
other process issued by him, may enforce the
due execution of the process by the means
provided by the law for enforcing the
execution of the process of other courts in like
cases. R.S., c. 160, s. 36.

**37.** (1) A supreme court judge may, in his
discretion, on special grounds, grant special
leave to appeal from any decision of the
juvenile court or a magistrate; in any case
where such leave is granted the procedure
upon appeal shall be such as is provided in
the case of a conviction on indictment, and
the provisions of the Criminal Code relating
to appeals from conviction on indictment
mutatis mutandis apply to such appeal, save
that the appeal shall be to a supreme court
judge instead of to the court of appeal, with
a further right of appeal to the court of
appeal by special leave of that court.
(2) No leave to appeal shall be granted
under this section unless the judge or court
granting such leave considers that in the
particular circumstances of the case it is
essential in the public interest or for the due
administration of justice that such leave be
granted.

this section shall be made within ten days of
the making of the conviction or order

said ten days. R.S., c. 160, s. 37.

**38.** This Act shall be liberally construed in
order that its purpose may be carried out,
namely, that the care and custody and
discipline of a juvenile delinquent shall
approximate as nearly as may be that which

far as practicable every juvenile delinquent
shall be treated, not as criminal, but as a
misdirected and misguided child, and one
needing aid, encouragement, help and assist
ance. R.S., c. 160, s. 38.

**39.** Nothing in this Act shall be construed
as nay i n g the effect of repealing or overriding
any provision of any provincial statute
intended for the protection or benefit of

under the provisions of the Criminal Code an
indictable offence, comes within the provisions
of a provincial statute, he may be dealt with
either under such statute or under this Act as
may be deemed to be in the best interests of
the child. R.S., c. 160, s. 39.

carrying out of the provisions of this Act have
been provided in such city, town, or other
portion of a province, by the municipal
council thereof or otherwise.
