Lading Act. R.S., c. 16, s. 1.

**2.** Every consignee of goods named in a
bill of lading, and every endorsee of a bill of
lading to whom the property in the goods
therein mentioned passes upon or by reason
of such consignment or endorsement, has and
is vested with all such rights of action and is
subject to all such liabilities in respect of such
goods as if the contract contained in the bill
of lading had been made with himself. R.S.,
c. 16, s. 2.

**3.** Xothing in this Act prejudices or affects
  * (_a_) any right of stoppage in transitu ;
  * (_b_) any right of an unpaid vendor under
the Civil Code of the Province of Quebec ;
  * (_c_) any right to claim freight against the
original shipper or owner ; or
  * (_d_) any liability of the consignee or endorsee
by reason or in consequence of his being
such consignee or endorsee, or of his receipt
of the goods by reason or in consequence of
such consignment or endorsement. R.S., c.
16, s. 3.

**4.** Every bill of lading in the hands of a
consignee or endorsee for valuable considera
tion, representing goods to have been shipped
on board a vessel or train, is conclusive
evidence of such shipment as against the
master or other person signing the bill of
lading, notwithstanding that such goods or
some part thereof may not have been so
shipped, unless such holder of the bill of
lading has actual notice, at the time of
receiving it, that the goods had not in fact
been laden on board, or unless such bill of
lading has a stipulation to the contrary ; but
the master or other person so signing may
exonerate himself in respect of such misrep
resentation by showing that it was caused
without any default on his part, and wholly
by the fault of the shipper or of the holder,
or of some person under whom the holder
claims. R.S., c. 16, s. 4.
