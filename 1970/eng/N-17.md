## NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION POLICY

**3.** It is hereby declared that an economic,
efficient and adequate transportation system
making the best use of all available modes of
transportation at the lowest total cost is
essential to protect the interests of the users
of transportation and to maintain the eco
nomic well-being and growth of Canada, and
that these objectives are most likely to be
achieved when all modes of transport are able
to compete under conditions ensuring that
having due regard to national policy and to
legal and constitutional requirements
  * (_a_) regulation of all modes of transport will
not be of such a nature as to restrict the
ability of any mode of transport to compete
freely with any other modes of transport ;
(6) each mode of transport, so far as
practicable, bears a fair proportion of the
real costs of the resources, facilities and
services provided that mode of transport at
public expense ;
  * (_c_) each mode of transport, so far as
practicable, receives compensation for the
resources, facilities and services that it is
required to provide as an imposed public
duty; and
  * (_d_) each mode of transport, so far as
practicable, carries traffic to or from any
point in Canada under tolls and conditions
that do not constitute
  * (_i_) an unfair disadvantage in respect of
any such traffic beyond that disadvantage
inherent in the location or volume of the
traffic, the scale of operation connected
therewith or the type of traffic or service
involved, or
  * (_ii_) an undue obstacle to the interchange
of commodities between points in Canada
or unreasonable discouragement to the
development of primary or secondary
industries or to export trade in or from
any region of Canada or to the movement
of commodities through Canadian ports;
and this Act is enacted in accordance with
and for the attainment of so much of these
under the jurisdiction of Parliament
to transportation. 1966-67, c. 69, s. 1.

## APPLICATION

**4.** This Act applies to the following modes
of transport :
  * (_a_) transport by railways to which the
Railway Act applies ;
(6) transport by air to which the Aeronautics
Act applies ;
  * (_c_) transport by water to which the Transport
Act applies and all other transport by water
to which the legislative authority of the
Parliament of Canada extends ;
  * (_d_) transport by a commodity pipeline
connecting a province with any other or
others of the provinces or extending beyond
the limits of a province ; and
  * (_e_) transport for hire or reward by a motor
vehicle undertaking connecting a province
with any other or others of the provinces or
extending beyond the limits of a province.
1966-67, c. 69, s. 4.

vided by this Act, the provisions of Part IV
relating to sittings of the Commission and
the disposal of business, witnesses and evi
dence, practice and procedure, orders and
decisions of the Commission and review
thereof and appeals therefrom apply in the
case of every inquiry, complaint, application
or other proceeding under this Act, the
Railway Act, the Aeronautics Act or the
Transport Act or any other Act of the
Parliament of Canada imposing any duty or
function on the Commission; and the Com
mission shall exercise and enjoys the same
jurisdiction and authority in matters under
any such Acts as are vested in the Commission
under Part IV of this Act.
(2) For greater certainty and the avoidance
of doubt, but without limiting the generality
of subsection (1), it is declared that the
provisions of Part IV of this Act,
namely sections 44 to 82 apply mutatis
mutandis in respect of any proceedings before
the Commission pursuant to this Act, the
Railway Act, the Aeronautics Act or the
Transport Act, and in the event of any conflict
between the provisions of Part IV and the
provisions of the Railway Act, the Aeronautics
Act or the Transport Act the provisions of that
Part prevail.
(3) Section 10 of the Railway Act applies
mutatis mutandis in respect of any proceedings
before the Commission pursuant to this Act,
the Aeronautics Act or the Transport Act, and
in the event of any conflict between section
10 of the Railway Act and any provision of
the Aeronautics Act or the Transport Act, the

disadvantage that may be deemed to be
inherent in the location or volume of the
traffic, the scale of operation connected
therewith or the type of traffic or sen-ice
involved, or

development of primary or secondary
industries or to export trade in or from
any region of Canada or to the movement
of commodities through Canadian ports;

  * (_b_) whether control by, or the interests of a
carrier in, another form of transportation
service, or control of a carrier by, or the
interest in the carrier of, a company or
person engaged in another form of trans
portation service may be involved.
(4 ) jf the Commission, after a hearing, finds
that the act, omission or rate in respect of
the appeal is made is prejudicial to the
public interest, the Commission may, not
withstanding the fixing of any rate pursuant
to section 278 of the Railway Act but having
regard to sections 276 and 277 of that Act,
make an order requiring the carrier to remove
the prejudicial feature in the relevant tolls or
conditions specified for the carriage of traffic

made or issued by the Commission.

by a committee of the Commission in respect
of a matter related to a particular mode of
transport, not being a matter of a specific
rate, licence or certificate, is objected to by

the ground that the order, rule or direction
discriminates against or is otherwise unfair to
his operations, the Commission shall, other
wise than by that committee of the Commis
sion, review the order, rule or direction, in
accordance with such rules of procedure as
the Commission may prescribe therefor, and

in a tariff that has been approved by and
filed with both the Commission and the
National Energy Board and is in effect ; and
the provisions of sections 50 to 59 of the
National Energy Board Act apply mutatis
mutandis to and in respect of the carriage by
the combined pipeline of any commodity and
as if the Commission were referred to in those
provisions instead of the National Energy
Board.
(3) Subject to subsection (2), the Commis
sion may make orders with respect to all
matters relating to traffic, tolls or tariffs of a
commodity pipeline company, and may
disallow any tariff of tolls, or any portion
thereof,
  * (_a_) that the Commission considers to be not
compensatory and not justified by the
public interest ; or
(6) where there is no alternative, effective
and competitive service by a common carrier
other than another commodity pipeline or
combination of commodity pipeline carriers,
that the Commission considers to be a tariff
that unduly takes advantage of a monopoly
situation favouring commodity pipeline
carriers ;
and may require the commodity pipeline
company, within a prescribed time, to substi
tute a tariff of tolls satisfactory to the
Commission in lieu thereof, or the Commission
may prescribe other tariffs in lieu of the tariff
or portion thereof so disallowed. 1966-67, c.

National Energy Board Act in respect of
pipelines under the jurisdiction of that Board ;
and to the extent that they are not inconsistent
with this Part of this Act, sections 26 to 39,
sections 57, 58 and 59 and Part V of the
National Energy Board Act apply mutatis
mutandis to and in respect of a commodity
pipeline company and its works and under
takings and as if the Commission were referred
to in those provisions instead of the National
Energy Board.

  * (_a_) a combined pipeline had been operated
as an oil or gas pipeline prior to the issue
of a certificate under this Act in respect
thereof, or
(6) the quantities of oil and gas, or either,
being moved by a combined pipeline in
relation to the quantities of other commodi
ties so moved are such as would, in the
opinion of the Governor in Council, indicate
that the pipeline is being operated as an oil
or gas pipeline rather than a commodity
pipeline,
the Governor in Council may, by order,
transfer the combined pipeline to the juris
diction of the National Energy Board and
during any period in which the order is in
force, the National Energy Board Act applies
mutatis mutandis to and in respect of the
combined pipeline, and the certificate in
respect thereof issued under this Act shall be
deemed to have been issued under that Act
in respect of the pipeline.
(3) An order made under subsection (2) may
terms and conditions as it considers
advisable, require a company operating a
commodity pipeline, according to its powers,
delay and with due care and diligence,
to receive, transport and deliver through its
pipeline any substance capable of being
transmitted therein.
(5) The Commission may, in like manner,
make like regulations in respect of commodity
pipelines as the National Energy Board may

made under subsection (5) is guilty of an
offence punishable on summary conviction.

commodity pipeline, or any part or parts
thereof, from all or any of the provisions of
this Act.
(2) In any order made under this section,

## PART IV

## GENERAL JURISDICTION AND

## POWERS IN RESPECT OF

## RAILWAYS

**43.** In this Part, words and expressions
have the same meaning as in the Railway Act.

**44.** Whenever, by an Act or document, the
Railway Committee of the Privy Council is
given any power or authority, or charged with
any duty with regard to any company,
railway, matter or thing, such power, authority
or duty may, or shall, be exercised by the
Commission. R.S., c. 234, s. 32.

**45.** (1) The Commission has full jurisdic
tion to inquire into, hear and determine any
application by or on behalf of any party
interested,
  * (_a_) complaining that any company, or
person, has failed to do any act, matter or
thing required to be done by the Railway
Act, or the Special Act, or by any regulation,
order or direction made thereunder by the
Governor in Council, the Minister, the
Commission, or any inspecting engineer or
other lawful authority, or that any company
or person has done or is doing any act,
matter or thing contrary to or in violation
of the Railway Act, or the Special Act, or
any such regulation, order, or direction, or
(6) requesting the Commission to make any
order, or give any direction, leave, sanction
or approval, that by law it is authorized to
make or give, or with respect to any matter,
act or thing, that by the Railway Act, or
the Special Act, is prohibited, sanctioned or
required to be done.
(2) The Commission may order and require
. .
y company or person to do forthwith, or
or at any specified time, and in any
prescribed by the Commission, so far
as is not inconsistent with the Railway Act,
any act, matter or thing that such company
or person is or may be required to do under
the Railway Act, or the Special Act, and may
forbid the doing or continuing of any act,
matter or thing that is contrary to the Railway
Act, or the Special Act ; and for the purposes
of the Railway Act has full jurisdiction to
hear and determine all matters whether of
law or of fact.
(3) The Commission, as respects the attend
ance and examination of witnesses, the
production and inspection of documents, the
enforcement of its orders, the entry on and
inspection of property, and other matters
necessary or proper for the due exercise of its
jurisdiction, has all such powers, rights and
privileges as are vested in a superior court.
(4) The fact that a receiver, manager, or
other official of any railway, or a receiver of
the property of a railway company, has been
appointed by any court in Canada or any
province thereof, or is managing or operating
a railway under the authority of any such
court, is not a bar to the exercise by the
Commission of its jurisdiction ; but every such
receiver, manager, or official is bound to
manage and operate any such railway in
accordance with the Railway Act and with the
orders and directions of the Commission,
whether general or referring particularly to
such railway; and every such receiver,
manager, or official, and every person acting
under him, shall obey all orders of the
Commission within its jurisdiction in respect
of such railway, and be subject to have them
enforced against him by the Commission,
notwithstanding the fact that such receiver,
manager, official, or person is appointed by
or acts under the authority of any court ; and
wherever by reason of insolvency, sale under
mortgage, or any other cause, a railway or
section thereof is operated, managed or held
otherwise than by the company, the Commis
sion may make any order it deems proper for
and applying the provisions of the
Railway Act to such case.
(5) The decision of the Commission as to
whether any company, municipality or person
is or is not a party interested within the
meaning of this section is binding and
conclusive upon all companies, municipalities
and persons. R.S., c. 234, s. 33.

**46.** (1) The Commission may make orders
or regulations
  * (_a_) with respect to any matter, act or thing
that by the Railway Act or the Special Act
is sanctioned, required to be done, or
prohibited ;
(6) generally for carrying the Railway Act
into effect ; and
  * (_c_) for exercising any jurisdiction conferred
on the Commission by any other Act of the
Parliament of Canada.
(2) Any such orders or regulations may be
made to apply to all cases or to any particular
case or class of cases, or to any particular
district, or to any railway or other work, or
section or portion thereof; and the Commis
sion may exempt any railway or other work,
or section or portion thereof, from the
operation of any such order or regulation for
such time or during such period as the
Commission deems expedient ; and such orders
or regulations may be for such time as the
Commission deems fit, and may be rescinded,
amended, changed, altered or varied as the
Commission thinks proper.
(3) The Commission may by regulation or
order provide penalties, when not already
provided in the Railway Act, to which every
company or person who offends against any
regulation or order made by the Commission
shall be liable.
(4) The imposition of any such penalty

**47.** Where it is complained bv or on behalf
c tne , L.rown, or any municipal . . or other
corporation, or any other person aggrieved,
the company has violated or committed
a breach of an agreement between the
complainant and the company, or where it is
complained by the company that any such
corporation or person has violated or commit
ted a breach of an agreement between the
company and such corporation or person, for
the provision, construction, reconstruction,
alteration, installation, operation, use or
maintenance by the company, or by such
corporation or person, of the railway or of
any line of railway intended to be operated
in connection with or as part of the railway,
or of any structure, appliance, equipment,
works, renewals or repairs upon or in connec
tion with the railway, the Commission shall
hear all matters relating to such alleged
violation or breach, and shall make such order
as to the Commission may seem reasonable
and expedient, and in such order may, in its
discretion, direct the company, or such
corporation or person, to do such things as
are necessary for the proper fulfilment of such
agreement, or to refrain from doing such acts
as constitute a violation or a breach thereof.
R.S., c. 234, s. 35.

**48.** The Commission may, of its own
motion, or shall, upon the request of the
Minister, inquire into, hear and determine
any matter or thing that, under the Railway
Act, it may inquire into, hear and determine
upon application or complaint, and with
respect thereto has the same powers as, upon
any application or complaint, are vested in it
by this Act. R.S., c. 234, s. 36.

**49.** Any power or authority vested in the
Commission may, though not so expressed,
be exercised from time to time, or at any
time, as the occasion may require. R.S., c. 234,
s. 37.

**50.** The Governor in Council may at any
time refer to the Commission for a report, or
other action, any question, matter or thing
arising, or required to be done, under the
Railway Act, or the Special Act, or any other
Act of the Parliament of Canada, and the
Commission shall without delay comply with
requirements of such reference. R.S., c.
s. 38.

**51.** (1) When the Commission, in the
exercise of any power vested in it, in and by
any order directs or permits any structure,
appliances, equipment, works, renewals or
repairs to be provided, constructed, recon
structed, altered, installed, operated, used or
maintained, it may, except as otherwise
expressly provided, order by what company,
municipality or person, interested or affected
by such order, as the case may be, and when
or within what time and upon what terms and
conditions as to the payment of compensation
or otherwise, and under what supervision, the
same shall be provided, constructed, recon
structed, altered, installed, operated, used and
maintained.
(2) The Commission may, except as other
wise expressly provided, order by whom, in
what proportion, and when, the cost and
expenses of providing, constructing, recon
structing, altering, installing and executing
such structures, equipment, works, renewals,
or repairs, or of the supervision, if any, or of
the continued operation, use or maintenance
thereof, or of otherwise complying with such
order, shall be paid. R.S., c. 234, s. 39.

**52.** Whenever any Act of the Parliament
of Canada requires or directs that before the
doing of any work the approval of the
Commission must be first obtained, and
whenever any such work has been done
without such approval, the Commission
nevertheless has power to approve the work
and to impose any terms and conditions upon
such company that may be thought proper in
the premises ; but where the doing of such
work affects the safety of the public or the
employees, no such approval shall be given
without due notice and hearing. R.S., c. 234,
s. 40.
such regulation, order or decision
requires any act, matter or thing to be done
for the safety of the public or the employees
of the railway, no extension shall be granted
without hearing on notice. R.S., c. 234, s. 41.
54, The Commission may, in any applica-
,- , . , .
tion, proceeding or matter of special impor
tance pending before it, if in the opinion of
the Commission the public interest so requires,
apply to the Minister of Justice to instruct
counsel to conduct or argue the case or any
particular question arising in the application,
proceeding or matter with respect to any
public interest that is or may be affected
thereby or by any order or decision which
may be made therein; and, upon such
application to him by the Commission, or of
his own motion, the Minister of Justice may
instruct counsel accordingly. R.S., c. 234,
s. 43.

**55.** (1) The Commission may of its own
motion, or upon the application of any party,
and upon such security being given as it
directs, or at the request of the Governor in
Council, state a case, in writing, for the
opinion of the Supreme Court of Canada
upon any question that in the opinion of the
Commission is a question of law or of the
jurisdiction of the Commission.
(2) The Supreme Court of Canada shall
hear and determine such question, and remit
the matter to the Commission with the
opinion of the Court thereon. R.S., c. 234,
s. 44.

**56.** (1) In determining any question of
fact, the Commission is not bound by the
finding or judgment of any other court, in
any suit, prosecution or proceeding involving
the determination of such fact, but such
finding or judgment, in proceedings before
the Commission, is prima facie evidence only.
(2) The pendency of any suit, prosecution
proceeding, in any other court, involving
of fact, does not deprive the
Commission of jurisdiction to hear and
determine the same questions of fact.
(3) The finding or determination of the
Commission upon any question of fact within
its jurisdiction is binding and conclusive. R.S.,
c. 234, s. 45.
Orders and Decisions

**57.** (1) The Commission may direct in any
order that such order or any portion or
provision thereof, shall come into force at a
future time or upon the happening of any
contingency, event or condition in such order

234, s. 47.

made for any longer time than the Commission
may deem necessary to enable the matter to
be heard and determined. R.S., c. 234, s. 48.

Commission, and upon hearing such of them
as appear and desire to be heard; and the
costs of such application are in the discretion
of the judge.
(3) No appeal, after leave therefor has been
obtained under subsection (2), lies unless it is
entered in the Supreme Court within sixty

leave to appeal.

appeal as aforesaid ; and the said appeal shall
be heard by such Court as speedily as
practicable.

such opinion.

by counsel or otherwise, upon the argument
of any such appeal.

be, may order and allow service to be made
