way of assistance according to his cultivated

is situated or, in case there is no such rural
municipality, by the government of the
province in which that township is situated.
(2) The sum to be awarded by way of
assistance under subsection (1) shall be
computed as follows:
  * (_a_) if the average yield of wheat in the
township is found by the Board to be more
than eight and not more than twelve bushels
per acre, the award shall be ten cents per
acre of the cultivated land of the farmer
for each cent, or fraction thereof, not
exceeding ten, by which the average price
is less than eighty cents per bushel ;

township is found by the Board to be more
than five and not more than eight bushels
per acre, the award shall be two dollars per
acre ;

township is found by the Board to be more

adjoining sections or lots, the award with
respect to such area shall be four dollars
per acre.
(3) In calculating the average yield of
wheat in a township for the purpose of
ascertaining whether the township is eligible
for award, the entire yield of the township
shall be included, but in calculating the
average yield of wheat in an eligible township
for the purpose of ascertaining the amount of
the award, there shall be excluded the yield
on all sections, and all settlement and river
lots, in the township having an average yield
of twelve or more bushels, and no award shall
be made in respect of those sections or
settlement or river lots.

the cultivated land of the farmer in any
eligible area ; or

eligible townships, cultivated lands in respect
of which an award may be paid, the amount
of the award to him shall, within the limits
prescribed by paragraphs (4)(a) and (b), be
calculated beginning with the township eligi
ble for award at the highest rate and
continuing with the township eligible for
award at the next highest rate.
  * (_g_) Where not less than one-half of the
cultivated land of a farmer is situated in a
township in respect of which an award may
be made under paragraph (2)(c), (d), or (e),

hundred dollars, the Minister may, in lieu of
