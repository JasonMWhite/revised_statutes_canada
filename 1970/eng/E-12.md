in any warehouse, at any time or by any
means, falls short or is deficient of the actual
quantity that ought to be or remain ware

the full duties on the balance of goods with
which the warehouse stands debited ; and the
goods remaining are subject to the duties on
the quantity deficient, and shall be sold for
payment thereof, by order of the Minister,

assigns, after deducting all penalties and
expenses incurred.

complete month after the date of original
warehousing, but no abatement shall be
allowed for a period of more than twelve
months, and every such abatement shall be
made in respect of each specific package and
shall in no case exceed the actual deficiency
found to exist in the package. R.S., c. 99,
s. 54.

Majesty s use in the name of the collector,
and shall be delivered to and kept by such
collector. R.S., c. 99, s. 115.

duties due by such person, and such duties
shall be paid and may be recovered as if such
penalty had not been paid or incurred. R.S.,
c. 99, s. 116.

**117.** (1) Every penalty or forfeiture
incurred and any term of imprisonment
imposed for any offence against this Act, or

conjunction with a pecuniary penalty or not,
may be sued for and recovered in, or may be
imposed, adjudged and ordered,
  * (_a_) by the Exchequer Court of Canada, or
any court of record having jurisdiction in
the premises, or
(6) if the amount or value of such penalty
or forfeiture does not exceed five thousand
dollars, and such term of imprisonment
does not exceed twelve months with hard
labour, exclusive of any term of imprison
ment that may be adjudged or ordered for
non-payment of any pecuniary penalty,
whether the offence in respect of which it

be an indictable offence or not, by summary
conviction, under the provisions of the
Criminal Code relating thereto, before a
police or stipendiary magistrate, or any two
justices of the peace having jurisdiction in
the place where the cause of prosecution
arises, or wherein the defendant is served
with process, or before any functionary,
tribunal or person empowered by the proper
legislative authority to perform acts usually
required to be done by two or more justices
of the peace and acting within the local
limits of his or its jurisdiction.
(2) Every action, suit or prosecution taken
under this Act, whether under the Criminal
Code, or before any court of competent
jurisdiction, shall be inscribed on a privileged
docket or roll and heard by privilege and
preference.
(3) Any such pecuniary penalty may, if not
forthwith paid, be levied by distress and sale
of the goods and chattels of the offender,
under the warrant of the court, judge,
magistrate, or justices having cognizance of
the case; or the said court, judge, magistrate
or justices may, in its or their discretion,
commit the offender to the common gaol for
a period not exceeding twelve months, unless
the penalty and costs, including those of
conveying the offender to such gaol and
stated in the warrant of committal, are sooner
paid. R.S., c. 99, s. 117.
1 18. Notwithstanding any other statute or

prescribed by this Act, and the court has no
power to suspend sentence. R.S., c. 99, s. 118.

**119.** Where a prosecution in respect of an
offence against this Act is brought before a
police or stipendiary magistrate, or before
any two justices of the peace, no other justice
of the peace shall sit or take part therein,
except that in any city or district in which
there is more than one police or stipendiary
magistrate, such prosecution may be tried
before any one of such police or stipendiary
magistrates. R.S., c. 99, s. 119.

**120.** Any information or complaint with
to any offence against this Act or any
law relating to excise, may, whenever
the prosecution, suit or proceeding is instituted
under the provisions of the Criminal Code
relating to summary convictions, be laid or
made within two years of the time when the
matter of the information or complaint arose.
R.S., c. 99, s. 120.

**121.** Where any article or thing is volun
tarily given up or abandoned by the owner to
any collector as forfeited under this Act, or
any sum of money is voluntarily paid to any
such collector as the amount of a penalty
incurred under this Act, such article or thing
may be dealt with as if lawfully condemned,
and such sum of money as if lawfully
recovered. R.S., c. 99, s. 121.

**122.** Where in any case it appears to the
Minister that a seizure has been made through
an error in judgment by an officer, and that
the retention of such seized property would
result unfairly in pecuniary loss to the person
from whom such property was seized, such
seizure may be released by the Minister,
without reference of the matter to the
Governor in Council. R.S., c. 99, s. 122.

may be divided between and paid to any
officer and any person giving information or
otherwise aiding in effecting a seizure resulting
in any such penalty or forfeiture.
(3) The Governor in Council may by such
regulations prescribe the manner in which the
proceeds of penalties and forfeitures shall be
distributed and may provide for payment of
awards forthwith after seizure of goods or the
preferring of charges where goods are not
based upon the value of the goods
the amount of excise duty evaded, the
penalties imposable upon any person guilty
of any violation of this Act, as the case may
be, and not dependent upon forfeiture or the
proceeds of forfeiture.

prescriptions for medicines and pharmaceuti
cal preparations.
(3) Where such spirits are purchased from a

duties otherwise imposed by law have been
paid thereon, the druggist is entitled to a
drawback of all such duty in excess of the
duties of excise.
(4) NO person shall receive spirits for any

**137.** (j) The duty upon spirits shall be
charged and computed as follows:
  * (_a_) upon the grain used for its production
at the rate of one gallon of proof spirits for
every twenty and four-tenths pounds, or in
a distillery where malt only, or a clear wort
process is used, upon the grain or malt used
for its production at the rate of one gallon
of proof spirits for every twenty-four
pounds ;
  * (_b_) upon the quantity of beer, wash or wort
fermented or made in the distillery, at the
rate of one gallon of proof spirits for every
fourteen gallons of beer, wash or wort ;
  * (_c_) upon the quantity of beer, wash or wort
fermented or made, in proportion to its
alcoholic value ;
  * (_d_) upon the quantity of spirits which passes
into the closed spirit-receivers, subject to
the following abatements:
  * (_i_) an abatement not exceeding three per
cent in distilleries using grain, and four
per cent in distilleries using molasses or
other saccharine matter only, for such
quantity of fusel-oil or other refuse as is
separated therefrom by a second process
distillation, the quantity so allowed in
being determined and de
in the presence of an officer or
otherwise accounted for in accordance
with departmental regulations;
  * (_ii_) an abatement for shrinkage by evapo
ration while maturing in the distillery, as
follows:
(A) when stored in warehouse in wood
en or in ventilated metal tanks
approved by the Minister an abatement
that shall not exceed four per cent for
the first year after the date of original
warehousing, three per cent for the
second year, two per cent for the third
year, two per cent for the fourth year,
and one per cent for each succeeding
year, up to fifteen years in all ; or
(B) when stored in warehouse in wood
en barrels, an abatement that shall not
exceed eight per cent for the first year
after the date of original warehousing,
six per cent for the second year, four
per cent for the third year, three per
cent for the fourth year and two per
cent for each succeeding year, up to
fifteen years in all ;
but no abatement shall be allowed after
the period of fifteen years, nor unless the
distiller has complied with all depart
mental regulations, nor unless the spirits
have been kept in wood or in ventilated
tanks approved by the Minister during
the whole period for which the abatement
is claimed ;
  * (_iii_) spirits re-warehoused and stored in
wooden or ventilated metal tanks or in
barrels will be subject to the same
abatement as if originally warehoused ;
  * (_iv_) an abatement not exceeding two per
cent may, in accordance with departmen
tal regulations, be allowed upon defi
ciencies found in distillery stock; and
  * (_v_) an abatement not exceeding three per
cent of the quantity originally ware
housed in wooden barrels may, in accord
ance with departmental regulations, be
allowed for wood absorption ;
upon the quantity of spirits sold or
from any distillery by the distiller,
by his agent or for his account ;
that method of computation that yields
amount of revenue is, in all cases,
(2) When any distiller is about to use
damaged grain or mill offal, and gives the
collector one week s notice of his intention to
do so, such officer as is instructed for that
purpose by the collector shall specially inspect
the beer or wash made from such damaged
grain or mill offal, and test its alcoholic value
and the quantity of such material that it
contains; and if he reports that the yield of
such damaged grain or mill offal is less than
one gallon of proof spirits to twenty and four-
tenths pounds, the Minister may authorize
the assessment of the duty on the highest
quantity ascertained by any of the other
methods, without reference to the quantity of
damaged grain or mill offal used by the
distiller. R.S., c. 99, s.137.

**138.** (1) For the purpose of computing the
duty by the methods prescribed in section
137,
  * (_a_) the quantity of grain is the quantity
actually weighed into the mash-tubs and
recorded in the books kept under the
requirements of this Act; except that
whenever there appears to be cause to doubt
the correctness of the quantity so entered
on the books, an inquiry may be made by
any inspector who may swear and examine
witnesses under oath and inquire as to the
quantity of grain taken to the distillery in
which such books are kept, and as to the
quantity of grain removed therefrom, and
generally into the matters referred to, and
shall determine, as nearly as may be, the
actual quantity of grain consumed in the
distillery; and the production may be
established in relation to the quantity of
grain or other fermentable material so
determined in proportions as shown in
137; and the duty may be assessed
and levied on the quantity of grain or other
material so determined ;
  * (_fr_) the quantity of beer, wash or wort
fermented or made in the distillery shall be
determined by the distiller, or as often as is
directed by any departmental regulation in
that behalf, by an officer, who shall gauge
the quantity in fermenting-tuns at the time
when the fermentation has been completed,
or when the beer is in a fit state for
distillation; and the quantities so deter
mined shall be recorded by the distiller in
a register of fermentation, under depart
mental regulations; except that whenever
there appears to be cause to doubt the
correctness of the quantity entered in the
register of fermentation, an inquiry may be
made by any inspector in the manner
hereinbefore provided, as to the capacity of
the fermenting-tuns used in the distillery,
the frequency with which they have been
used, and the quantity of beer, wash or wort
from time to time fermented therein ; and
the duty may be assessed and collected in
the proportion of one gallon of proof spirits
for every fourteen gallons of beer, wash or
wort determined by such inspector after
such inquiry, to have been fermented in the
distillery ;
  * (_c_) the alcoholic value of any beer, wash or
wort made in any distillery may be
determined by any inspector or by any
collector or other officer authorized thereto,
who, as often as he deems necessary, but
not more frequently than once in each day,
may take out of any beer, wash or wort,
then in the distillery a quantity not
exceeding twenty-eight gallons, as a sample,
which he may distil or cause to be distilled,
for the purpose of any computation under
this Act, and he may calculate the value or
strength of the beer, wash or wort used in
that distillery according to the result
ascertained from the sample so taken; or
he may, at any time, test the strength of
any beer, wash or wort then in the distillery
by its attenuation or by running a portion
thereof, not exceeding the contents of any
one fermenting-tun, through the stills, in
the ordinary course of working such distil
lery, and may require the ordinary opera
tives of such distillery to do the work, or
may introduce other operatives into the
distillery for that purpose ; and for the
purpose of any such computation as
aforesaid, he may calculate the alcoholic
value or strength of the beer, wash or wort
used in that distillery according to the
result ascertained from the portion of such
beer, wash or wort so distilled ; and the
alcoholic value of the beer, wash or wort, as
determined by either of the above methods,
may be applied to or used in the computa
tion and charge of duty on the beer, wash
or wort made in that distillery ;
  * (_d_) the quantity of spirits that passes into
the closed spirit-receivers shall be ascer
tained and determined by weighing the
quantity and testing the strength thereof at
such time and place and in such manner as
is prescribed from time to time by depart
mental regulations; and
  * (_e_) the quantity of spirits sold or removed
from any distillery by the distiller is the
quantity recorded in the distillery stock
books kept under the provisions of this Act ;
but whenever any inspector has cause to
doubt the correctness of the quantity so
recorded, he may inquire, or cause an
inquiry to be made, in the manner herein
before provided, as to the quantity of spirits
sold by the distiller or by his agent, or for
his account, and as to the quantity removed
from the distillery by any agency or vehicle
whatever, and also as to the quantity of
duty-paid spirits brought into the distillery ;
and for the purpose of such inquiry, all
shipping notes or bills of lading signed by
the distiller or by his agent shall be taken
as evidence of the sale or removal by him
from his distillery of the quantity therein
specified, and the evidence on oath of any
railway clerk, stationmaster or agent, or of
any warehouseman or common carrier or
shipping agent, as to the truth of the
accounts kept by him of shipments or
removals of spirits by any distiller, is
sufficient proof of the truth of such
accounts ; and the evidence on oath of any
person who has purchased any spirits from
a distiller or from his agent, shall be taken
as proof that the spirits so bought were
manufactured at the distillery of the
distiller selling the spirits, unless the
contrary is shown ; and all packages of
spirits not otherwise described in the
relating thereto, or proved to contain some
greater or less quantity, shall be reckoned
as puncheons containing each one hundred
and fifty gallons of proof spirits; and the
difference between the quantity shown by
such inquiry to have been sold by the
distiller or removed from his distillery, and
the quantity of duty-paid spirits brought
into the distillery, shall be held to be the
quantity liable to duty under this Act.
(2) The inquiries of an inspector or collector,
as n tn ^ s section authorized, may be made
for any period not more than one year before
the time when the inquiry is commenced ; and
if it is found that during that period the
returns have been made for, and the duty
charged on a less quantity of spirits than is
ascertained and determined by the result of
such inquiry, the additional duty then
determined becomes due and payable within
five days after the distiller has been notified
of the result of such inquiry ; and the payment
of such additional duty shall be enforced in
the same manner, and under the same
conditions and penalties, as the payment of
the duty mentioned in the monthly returns
in respect of other matters subject to excise as
in this Act provided.
(3) jf t h e determination of the officer is
disputed, the burden of proof of the error or
wrong lies upon the person alleging it.
(4) If during any period the standard of
production established by this Act has not
been reached, the Minister may require the
distiller to pay the duty on the quantity of
spirits equivalent to the deficiency so deter
mined. R.S., c. 99, s. 138.

**139.** (1) The following, namely,
  * (_a_) the spirit-receiver, doubler, low wines
receiver, faints receiver, the safe or
apparatus enclosing the tail of the worm or
still;
(6) every pump used for removing any
spirit, beer, wash or wort or other matter to
or from any vessel, or from one vessel to
another, and every lock, pipe, valve, duct,
conduit, cock or connection used for secur
ing, leading to or from, or between, or for
giving access to any of the vessels herein
mentioned or referred to ; and
  * (_c_) every valve, pipe, cock, gauge, pump,
lock or other apparatus, utensil, appliance
or arrangement for securing, gauging,
ascertaining, testing or proving the quantity
or strength of any spirit, beer, wash or
worts, manufactured or distilled, or for
preventing the undue abstraction of any
such spirits, beer, wash or worts;
shall be constructed, arranged and applied at
the cost of the distiller, in accordance with
such plans, designs, drawings and regulations,
and of such materials as are, from time to
time, approved by the Minister.
(2) Every pipe, trough or conduit used for
the conveyance of spirits shall be painted or
coloured a light blue.
(3) Every pipe, trough or conduit used for
the conveyance of water shall be painted or
coloured white.
(4) Every pipe, trough or conduit used for
the conveyance of beer, wash or wort shall be
painted or coloured red. R.S., c. 99, s. 139.

**140.** On every cask or barrel used in a
distillery, or for keeping or delivering out any
spirits, there shall, at all times, be legibly cut,
branded or painted in oil colours, on one head
the name of the distiller, and on the other
head such marks, numbers and other informa
tion as are required by any departmental
regulation in that behalf. R.S., c. 99, s. 140.

**141.** (1) The tail of every worm in every
distillery shall be enclosed in a locked or
sealed safe, or other suitable apparatus, in
which the strength of the spirits and low wines
flowing from the worm may be approximately
ascertained by the inspection of the hydrom-
or other suitable instruments contained
(2) Every such safe shall be constructed in
manner and secured by such means and
by such mechanism as are approved by the
Minister.
(3) From the said closed safe or apparatus
all low wines, faints and spirits, from time to
time running from the end of the worm, shall
be conveyed to the doubler or closed spirit-
receiver, as the case may be, through suitable
pipes of such metal as required by depart
mental regulations, visible throughout the
whole of their length, with stop cocks and
