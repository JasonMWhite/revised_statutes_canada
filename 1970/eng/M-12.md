## SCHEDULE

## CONVENTION
Whereas many species of birds in the course of their annual
traverse certain parts of the Dominion of Canada
the United States ; and
Whereas many of these species are of great value as a source
of food or in destroying insects which are injurious to forests
and forage plants on the public domain, as well as to agricul
tural crops, in both Canada and the United States, but are
nevertheless in danger of extermination through lack of ade
quate protection during the nesting season or while on their
way to and from their breeding grounds;
His Majesty the King of the United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Ireland and of the British dominions beyond the
seas, Emperor of India, and the United States of America, being
desirous of saving from indiscriminate slaughter and of insuring
the preservation of such migratory birds as are either useful to
man or are harmless, have resolved to adopt some uniform
system of protection which shall effectively accomplish such
objects, and to the end of concluding a convention for this
purpose have appointed as their respective plenipotentiaries:
