aggregate net value of the property passing
on the death of a person the value of any
such property acquired pursuant to a bona
fide purchase made from the deceased for a
consideration in money or money s worth
paid or agreed to be paid to the deceased for
his own use or benefit, unless such purchase
was made otherwise than for full consideration
in money or money s worth paid or agreed to
be paid as hereinbefore described, in which
case there shall be included in computing the
aggregate net value of the property passing
on the death of the deceased in respect of the
property so acquired only the amount by
which the value of the property so acquired
computed as of the date of its acquisition
exceeds the amount of the consideration
actually so paid or agreed to be paid.
(2) For the purposes of subsection (1), where
any property has been disposed of by the
deceased under an arrangement or under
standing described in paragraph 3(l)(/i), the
property so disposed of shall be deemed to
have been acquired pursuant to a bona fide
purchase made from the deceased for a
consideration in money or money s worth
paid or agreed to be paid to the deceased for
his own use or benefit, except that
  * (_a_) if the capitalized value, as determined
in accordance with the regulations, of the
annuity or other periodic amount referred
to in paragraph 3(l)(/i) does not exceed the
capitalized value, as similarly so deter-
mined, of an amount per annum equal to
5% of the value of the property so disposed
of, the amount of the consideration shall
be deemed to be nil ; and
(6) if the capitalized value, as determined
in accordance with the regulations, of the
said annuity or other periodic amount
exceeds the capitalized value, as similarly
so determined, of an amount per annum
equal to 5% of the value of the property so
disposed of, the amount of the consideration
shall be deemed to be the aggregate of the
following amounts, namely, for each year
in which any payment or payments of or
on account of the said annuity or other
periodic amount were made to the deceased,
the amount by which
  * (_i_) the payment or aggregate of the
payments so made in that year,
exceeds
  * (_ii_) 5% of the value of the property so
disposed of,
plus interest at 5% per annum on the
amount of the excess for that year, from
the time the payment or payments were so
made until the time of the death of the
deceased.
(3) For the purposes of this section, property
transferred to or acquired by a purchaser or
transferee under the terms of an agreement
described in paragraph 3(l)(t) shall, notwith
standing anything in this section, be deemed
not to have been acquired pursuant to a bona
fide purchase made as described in this section.
(4) Notwithstanding section 3, there shall
not be included in computing the aggregate
net value of the property passing on the
death of a person the value of any property
comprised in a devise or bequest made to the
deceased by a testator that, by virtue of a
provision against lapse contained in any
applicable statute or law relating to wills or
the succession to property of a testator, is
regarded as having taken effect as though the
deceased had died after the death of the
testator, notwithstanding the death of the
deceased before that time. 1958, c. 29, s. 4;
1960, c. 29, s. 2.

bona fide and for full consideration paid or
agreed to be paid to the deceased for his
own use or benefit, to the extent that such
debts and encumbrances were outstanding
immediately prior to his death ; and
  * (_b_) reasonable funeral expenses and surro
gate, probate and other like court fees in
respect of the death of the deceased (but
not including solicitors charges or the
expenses of administering property or

(2) For the purposes of this section, a debt
or other obligation of the deceased that was
created or imposed by or under the authority
of a statute shall, to the extent that such debt
or obligation was outstanding immediately
prior to his death, be deemed to be a debt
incurred by the deceased as described in
paragraph (l)(a). 1958, c. 29, s. 5; 1960, c. 29,
s. 3.

**6.** Notwithstanding section 5, no deduction

receive or otherwise obtain, after the
death of the deceased and before the
death of such spouse, any of the capital
of the settlement or any use thereof, or

which such spouse is entitled or any use
thereof,
or by the transfer of property to a trust
that at the time of the transfer was a
settlement to which subparagraphs (i) and

attaining such age, not exceeding forty
years, as is specified in the will or other
instrument under or by virtue of which

child will, if ever, become 26 years of
age,

income, computed in accordance with
the Income Tax Act, for each of the
three taxation years of the child (or
such number of taxation years as the
child had if that number is less than
three) immediately preceding the
taxation year in which the deceased
died, exceeds $15,000;

interest and mortality of any person, and, at
any time within four years after the death of
the deceased, an event has occurred, whether
