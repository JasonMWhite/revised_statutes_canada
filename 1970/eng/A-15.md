## PARTI

## LIABILITY FOR ANTI-DUMPING DUTY

**3.** There shall be levied, collected and paid
upon all dumped goods entered into Canada
in respect of which the Tribunal has made an
order or finding, before the entry of the goods,
that the dumping of goods of the same
description
  * (_a_) has caused, is causing or is likely to
cause material injury to the production in
Canada of like goods, or
  * (_b_) has materially retarded or is materially
retarding the establishment of the produc
tion in Canada of like goods,
1968-69, c. 10, s. 3.

**4.** There shall be levied, collected and paid
upon all dumped goods entered into Canada
  * (_a_) in respect of which the Tribunal has
made an order or finding, after the entry
of the goods, that the dumping of the goods
or of goods of the same description
  * (_i_) has caused material injury to the
production in Canada of like goods, or
  * (_ii_) would have caused material injury to
such production except for the fact that
provisional duty was applied in respect
of the goods, and
  * (_b_) that were entered provisionally into
Canada during the period commencing on
the day that the Deputy Minister made a
preliminary determination of dumping in
respect of the goods or of goods of the same
description and ending on the day the order
or finding referred to in paragraph (a) was
made by the Tribunal,
an anti-dumping duty in an amount equal to
the margin of dumping of the entered goods
but not exceeding the provisional duty, if
any, payable in respect of the goods. 1968-69,
c. 10, s. 4.

**5.** There shall be levied, collected and paid
upon all dumped goods entered into Canada
  * (_a_) in respect of which the Tribunal has
made an order or finding, after the entry
of the goods, that
  * (_i_) either
(A) there has occurred a considerable
importation of like goods that were
dumped, which dumping has caused
material injury to the production in
Canada of like goods or would have
caused material injury to such produc
tion except for the application of anti
dumping measures, or
(B) the importer of the goods was or
should have been aware that the
exporter was practising dumping and
that such dumping would cause materi
al injury to the production in Canada
of like goods, and
  * (_ii_) material injury has been caused to
the production in Canada of like goods
by reason of the fact that the entered
goods constitute a massive importation
or form part of a series of importations
into Canada of dumped goods that in the
aggregate are massive and that have
occurred within a relatively short period
of time, and in order to prevent the
recurrence of such material injury, it
appears necessary to the Tribunal that
duty be assessed on the entered goods,
and
(6) that were entered into Canada during
the period commencing 90 days before the
Deputy Minister made a preliminary deter
mination of dumping in respect of the
goods or goods of the same description and
ending on the day that the preliminary
determination was made,
an anti-dumping duty in an amount equal to
the margin of dumping of the entered goods.
1968-69, c. 10, s. 5.

**6.** The importer of any goods in respect of
which duty is payable pursuant to section 3,
4 or 5 shall, on demand of the Deputy
Minister, pay or cause to be paid all duties
imposed by this Act upon the goods entered
into Canada. 1968-69, c. 10, s. 6.

**7.** (1) The Governor in Council may
exempt any goods or classes of goods from
the application of this Act.
(2) Every order made under this section
shall be published in the Canada Gazette.
1968-69, c. 10, s. 7.

**8.** For the purposes of this Act,
  * (_a_) goods are dumped if the normal value
of the goods exceeds the export price of the
goods ; and
(6) the margin of dumping of any goods is
the amount by which the normal value of
the goods exceeds the export price of the
goods. 1968-69, c. 10, s. 8.

**9.** (1) Subject to subsection (5), the normal
value of any goods is the price of like goods
when sold by the exporter
  * (_a_) to purchasers with whom, at the time of
the sale of the like goods, the exporter is
not associated,
  * (_b_) in the ordinary course of trade for home
consumption under competitive conditions,
  * (_c_) during such period, in relation to the
time of the sale of the goods to the importer
in Canada, as may be prescribed by the
regulations, and
  * (_d_) at the place from which the goods were
shipped directly to Canada or, if the goods
have not been shipped to Canada, at the
place from which the goods would be
shipped directly to Canada under normal
conditions of trade,
as adjusted by allowances calculated in the
manner prescribed by the regulations to reflect
the differences in the terms and conditions of
sale, in taxation and other differences relating
to price comparability between the sale of the
goods to the importer in Canada and the
sales by the exporter of the like goods but
with no other allowances affecting price
comparability whatever.
(2) In the application of subsection (1) in
the case of any goods
  * (_a_) if there was not, in the opinion of the
Deputy Minister, such a number of sales of
like goods made by the exporter at the
place described in paragraph (l)(d) as to
permit a proper comparison with the sale of
the goods to the importer in Canada, there
shall be substituted for that place the place
located nearest thereto at which like goods
were sold by the exporter ; and
  * (_b_) if there was not a sufficient number of
sales of like goods made by the exporter by
reason of the fact that the exporter sold
goods solely or primarily for export, but
there were sales of like goods for home
consumption in the country of export by
other vendors, there shall be substituted for
the exporter such one of any such vendors
as the Deputy Minister may specify.
(3) In determining the normal value of any
under subsection (1), the price of like
when sold by the exporter to purchasers
the period referred to in paragraph
shall be
  * (_a_) the price at which the preponderance of
sales of like goods that comply with all the
terms and conditions that are referred to in
subsection (1) or that are applicable by
virtue of subsection (2) was made by the
exporter to purchasers throughout the
period ; and
  * (_b_) when there is no such preponderance of
sales at a single price throughout the period,
the weighted average of the prices at which
like goods are so sold by the exporter to
purchasers throughout the period.
(4) Where goods imported into Canada and
goods sold for home consumption are like
goods except only that the goods sold for
home consumption have applied to them a
trade mark, as defined in the Trade Marks
Act, that is not applied to the goods imported
into Canada, and goods like the goods
imported are not sold for home consumption,
the goods imported and the goods sold for
home consumption shall be deemed to be like
goods for the purposes of this section if, in
the opinion of the Minister,
  * (_a_) the goods are being imported into
Canada without that trade mark applied to
them in order to avoid the operation of
subsection (1), and
  * (_b_) it is probable that there will be applied
to the goods, subsequent to their importation
into Canada, that trade mark or any other
mark so closely resembling that trade mark
that it is likely to be taken therefor.
(5) Where the normal value of any goods
cannot be determined under subsection (1) by
reason that there was not a sufficient number
of sales of like goods that comply with all the
terms and conditions that are referred to in
that subsection or that are applicable by
virtue of subsection (2), the normal value of
the goods shall be determined, at the option
of the Deputy Minister in any case or class of
cases, as
  * (_a_) such price of like goods when sold by
the exporter to importers in any country
other than Canada during the period
referred to in paragraph (l)(c) as, in the
opinion of the Deputy Minister, fairly
reflects the market value of the goods at
the time of the sale of the goods to the
importer in Canada, as adjusted by allow
ances calculated in the manner prescribed
by the regulations to reflect the differences
in the terms and conditions of sale, in
taxation and other differences relating to
price comparability between the sale of the
goods to the importer in Canada and the
sales of the like goods by the exporter to
importers in any country other than Canada
but with no other allowances affecting price
comparability whatever ; or
(6) the aggregate of
  * (_i_) the cost of production of the goods,
and
  * (_ii_) an amount for administrative, selling
and all other costs and for profits,
calculated in such manner as may be
prescribed by the regulations.
(6) In subsections (2) and (5) the expression
"sufficient number of sales" with reference to
any goods has the meaning given to that
expression by the regulations.
(7) Notwithstanding subsections (1) and (5),
the normal value of any goods that are
shipped directly to Canada from a country
where, in the opinion of the Minister,
  * (_a_) the government of that country has a
monopoly or substantial monopoly of its
export trade, or
(6) domestic prices are substantially deter
mined by the government of that country,
shall be determined in such manner as the
Minister prescribes. 1968-69, c. 10, s. 9.

**10.** (1) Subject to this section, the export
price of any goods, notwithstanding any
invoice or affidavit to the contrary, is an
amount equal to the lesser of
  * (_a_) the exporter s sale price for the goods,
and
(6) the importer s purchase price for the
goods,
adjusted in the manner prescribed by the
where applicable, the place substituted
therefor in determining normal value by
virtue of paragraph 9(2)(a).
(2) Where, in respect of any imported goods,
  * (_a_) there is no exporter s sale price or
importer s purchase price at the time of
importation of the goods, or
  * (_b_) the Deputy Minister is of the opinion
that the export price, as determined under
subsection (1), is unreliable
  * (_i_) by reason that the sale of the goods
for export to Canada was a sale between
associated persons, or
  * (_ii_) by reason of a compensatory arrange
ment made between any two or more of
the following, namely, the manufacturer
or producer, the vendor, the exporter, the
importer and any other party, that
directly or indirectly affects or relates to
(A) the price of the goods,
(B) the sale of the goods,
(C) the net return to the exporter,
vendor, manufacturer or producer of
the goods, or
(D) the net cost to the importer of the
goods,
the export price of the goods shall be deemed
to be
  * (_c_) if the goods were sold by the importer
in the condition in which they were
imported to a person with whom, at the
time of the said sale, he was not associated,
the price for which the goods were so sold
less an allowance calculated in the manner
prescribed by the regulations
  * (_i_) for costs, including the duties imposed
under the Customs Tariff and taxes,
incurred on or after the importation of
the goods and their sale by the importer,
  * (_ii_) for profits on the sale of the goods to
that person, and
  * (_iii_) for all charges on the goods resulting
from or arising after their shipment from
the place described in paragraph 9(l)(d),
or
  * (_d_) in any case other than that described in
paragraph (c), the price determined in the
manner prescribed by the regulations.
(3) j n the case of any goods referred to in
paragraph (2)(a), notwithstanding any other
provision of this Act, no entry of such goods
shall be considered, for the purposes of this
Act, to be perfected until
  * (_a_) the importer, exporter or owner, or his
agent or consignee, has delivered to the
Deputy Minister such documents and
information including statements showing
the terms and conditions on which the
goods have been sold or accounted for or
disposed of in Canada as the Deputy
Minister requests in order to determine the
export price of the goods, and the export
price is determined pursuant to paragraph
(2)(c);or
(6) the export price is determined pursuant
to paragraph (2)(d) or pursuant to section

**11.**
(4^ jr or greater certainty, any agreement
pursuant to which the manufacturer or
producer, the vendor or the exporter of any
goods undertakes directly or indirectly, or in
any manner whatever, to indemnify, pay on
behalf of or reimburse the importer of the
goods for all or any part of the dumping duty
that may be levied upon the entry of the
goods, shall be deemed to be a compensatory
arrangement affecting the price of the goods
within the meaning of paragraph (2)(6). 1968-
69, c. 10, s. 10.

**11.** Where, in the opinion of the Deputy
Minister, sufficient information has not been
furnished or is not available to enable the
determination of normal value or export price
under section 9 or 10, the normal value or
export price, as the case may be, shall be
determined in such manner as the Minister
prescribes. 1968-69, c. 10, s. 11.

**12.** (1) Goods bona fide exported to Canada
from an y country but passing in transit
another shall, upon such terms and
as to shipment, documentation,
transhipment or the like as may
prescribed by the regulations, have the
value determined as if they were
directly to Canada from such first
country.
(2) In the case of any imported goods that
  * (_a_) were shipped indirectly to Canada from
the country of origin through one or more
other countries, and
  * (_b_) would, but for this section, have a
normal value as computed under section 9
that is less than the normal value would be
if the country of export were the country of
origin,
the normal value of the goods, notwithstand
ing any other provision of this Act, shall,
upon such terms and conditions as to shipment,
documentation, warehousing, transhipment or
the like as may be prescribed by the
regulations, have the normal value determined
as if they were shipped directly to Canada
from such first mentioned country. 1968-69, c.
10, s. 12.

## PART II

## PROCEDURE

**13.** (1) The Deputy Minister shall forth
with cause an investigation to be initiated
respecting the dumping of any goods, on his
own initiative or on receipt of a complaint in
writing by or on behalf of producers in
Canada of like goods, if
  * (_a_) he is of the opinion that there is
evidence that the goods have been or are
being dumped ; and
(6) either
  * (_i_) he is of the opinion that there is
evidence, or
  * (_ii_) the Tribunal advises that it is of the
opinion that there is evidence,
that the dumping referred to in paragraph
  * (_a_) has caused, is causing or is likely to
cause material injury to the production in
Canada of like goods or has materially
retarded or is materially retarding the
establishment of the production in Canada
of like goods.
(2) Where, after receipt of a written com
respecting the dumping of any goods,
the Deputy Minister decides not to initiate
investigation, he shall send a written
notice of his decision to the complainant
out therein the reasons for such
decision.
(3) Where the Deputy Minister, after receipt
of a written complaint respecting the dumping
of any goods, decides not to initiate an
investigation by reason only that in his
opinion there is no evidence of material injury
or retardation within the meaning of para
graph (1X6),
  * (_a_) the Deputy Minister, or
(6) the complainant, within such period
from the date of the notice referred to in
subsection (2) as is prescribed by the
regulations,
may refer to the Tribunal the question
whether there is any evidence that the
dumping of the goods has caused, is causing
or is likely to cause material injury to the
production in Canada of like goods or has
materially retarded or is materially retarding
the establishment of the production in Canada
of like goods.
(4) The Deputy Minister shall, upon receipt
of a notice in writing from the Tribunal
pursuant to subsection 16(2), cause an investi
gation to be initiated respecting the dumping
of any goods described in the notice.
(5) Where the Deputy Minister causes an
investigation to be initiated respecting the
dumping of any goods, he shall cause notice
of the investigation
  * (_a_) to be given to the importer, the exporter,
the government of the country of export,
the complainant, if any, and such other
persons as may be specified by the regula
tions, and
(6) to be published in the Canada Gazette.
(6) The Deputy Minister shall cause an
investigation respecting the dumping of any
goods to be terminated and shall not make
any preliminary determination of dumping
in respect of such goods,
  * (_a_) where he is satisfied that
  * (_i_) there is insufficient evidence of dump
ing to justify proceeding with the inves
tigation, or
  * (_ii_) the margin of dumping of the goods
or the actual or potential volume of
the Tribunal, he comes to the conclusion
that there is no evidence that the dumping
of goods has caused, is causing or is likely
to cause material injury to the production
in Canada of like goods or has materially
retarded or is materially retarding the
establishment of the production in Canada
of like goods ;
and shall thereupon cause notice of such
termination to be given to the persons and in
the manner provided in subsection (5).
(7) Where, in the case of an investigation
described in paragraph (6)(b), the Deputy
Minister comes to the conclusion that there is
no evidence of material injury or retardation
within the meaning of that paragraph,
  * (_a_) he shall cause notice thereof to be given
to the persons and in the manner provided
in subsection (5) ; and
  * (_b_) he or the complainant, if any, may,
within such period from the date of the
notice described in paragraph (a) as is
prescribed by the regulations, refer to the
Tribunal the question whether there is any
evidence that the dumping of the said
goods has caused, is causing or is likely to
cause material injury to the production in
Canada of like goods or has materially
retarded or is materially retarding the
establishment of the production in Canada
of like goods ;
and where a reference has been made to the
Tribunal under paragraph (b), the Deputy
Minister may not terminate the investigation
by reason only that in his opinion there is no
evidence of material injury or retardation
within the meaning of that paragraph unless
the Tribunal advises that in its opinion there
is no evidence of such material injury or
retardation.
(8) When a reference has been made to the
Tribunal pursuant to subsection (3) or (7) on
the question whether there is any evidence
that the dumping of goods has caused, is
or is likely to cause material injury
the production in Canada of like goods or
materially retarded or is materially
the establishment of the production
in Canada of like goods, the Tribunal shall
render its advice on the question as soon as
possible, without holding any hearings there
on, on the basis of such information and
advice as is then available to it. 1968-69, c. 10,
s. 13.

**14.** (1) Where an investigation respecting
the dumping of any goods has not been
terminated under subsection 13(6) and the
Deputy Minister, as a result of the investiga
tion, is satisfied that
  * (_a_) the goods have been or are being
dumped, and
(6) the margin of dumping of the dumped
goods and the actual or potential volume
thereof is not negligible,
he shall make a preliminary determination of
dumping specifying the goods or description
of goods to which such determination applies.
(2) When the Deputy Minister has made a
preliminary determination of dumping in
respect of any goods or description of goods,
he shall
  * (_a_) cause notice of the determination to be
given to the importer, the exporter, the
government of the country of export, the
complainant, if any, and such other persons
as may be specified by the regulations,
stating the reasons for such determination ;
(6) cause notice of the determination to be
published in the Canada Gazette;
  * (_c_) cause to be filed with the Secretary of
the Tribunal notice in writing of the
determination, stating the reasons therefor,
together with such other material relating
to the determination as may be required
under the rules of the Tribunal ; and
  * (_d_) in accordance with directions given by
the Minister, take such proceedings as may
be necessary in order to make a final
determination of dumping, in accordance
with subsection 17(1), within three months
from the date of the preliminary determi
nation. 1968-69, c. 10, s. 14.
ig. (j) Where the Deputy Minister has
a preliminary determination of dump-
ing in respect of any goods or description of
during the period commencing on the day the
preliminary determination was made and
ending on the day that an order or finding is
made by the Tribunal with respect thereto
are deemed, for all purposes of this Act, to be
entered provisionally, and the importer of
any goods so entered during such period shall
  * (_a_) pay or cause to be paid, on demand of
the Deputy Minister, provisional duty in
an amount not greater than the margin of
dumping of the said goods ; or
(6) post security, on demand of the Deputy
Minister, in a prescribed form and in an
amount or to a value not greater than the
margin of dumping of the said goods.
(2) Any provisional duty or security paid
or posted by or on behalf of an importer in
respect of the entry of any goods pursuant to
subsection (1) shall, except to the extent of
the duty payable in respect of the goods, be
returned to the importer forthwith following
the final determination made by the Deputy
Minister under section 17, in respect of the
goods. 1968-69, c. 10, s. 15.

**16.** (1) The Tribunal, forthwith upon
receipt by the Secretary under subsection 14(2)
of a notice of a preliminary determination of
dumping, shall, in respect of the goods to
which the preliminary determination of
dumping applies, make inquiry as to whether
  * (_a_) the dumping of the goods that are the
subject of the inquiry
  * (_i_) has caused, is causing or is likely to
cause material injury to the production
in Canada of like goods,
  * (_ii_) has materially retarded or is materi
ally retarding the establishment of the
production in Canada of like goods, or
  * (_iii_) would have caused material injury
to the production in Canada of like goods
except for the fact that provisional duty
was applied in respect of the goods ; or
  * (_b_) in the case of any goods to which the
preliminary determination of dumping
applies,
  * (_i_) either
(A) there has occurred a considerable
importation of like goods that were
dumped, which dumping has caused
material injury to the production in
Canada of like goods or would have
caused material injury to such produc
tion except for the application of anti
dumping measures, or
(B) the importer of the goods was or
should have been aware that the
exporter was practising dumping and
that such dumping would cause materi
al injury to the production in Canada
of like goods, and
  * (_ii_) material injury has been caused to
the production in Canada of like goods
by reason of the fact that the entered
goods constitute a massive importation
or form part of a series of importations
into Canada of dumped goods that in the
aggregate are massive and that have
occurred within a relatively short period
of time, and in order to prevent the
recurrence of such material injury, it
appears necessary to the Tribunal that
duty be assessed on the entered goods.
(2) Where, during an inquiry described in
subsection (1) respecting any goods to which
a preliminary determination of dumping
applies, the Tribunal comes to the conclusion
that
  * (_a_) there is evidence that goods the charac
teristics of which closely resemble the goods
to which the preliminary determination
applies have been or are being dumped,
and
  * (_b_) the dumping referred to in paragraph
  * (_a_) has caused, is causing or is likely to
cause material injury to the production in
Canada of like goods or has materially
retarded or is materially retarding the
establishment of the production in Canada
of like goods,
the Tribunal, by notice in writing setting out
the description of such goods, may direct the
Minister to cause an investigation to
initiated respecting the dumping of such
notice of a preliminary determination of
dumping, in the case of any goods to which
the preliminary determination applies, make
such order or finding as the nature of the
matter may require, and shall declare to what
goods or description of goods including, where
applicable, from what supplier and from what
country of export, the order or finding applies.
(4) The Tribunal, in considering any ques
tion relating to the production in Canada of
any goods or the establishment in Canada of
such production, shall take fully into account
the provisions of paragraph 4(a) of the
Agreement on Implementation of Article VI
of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade signed at Geneva, Switzerland, on June
30, 1967.
(5) The Secretary shall forward by regis
tered mail a copy of each order or finding to
the Deputy Minister, the importer, the
exporter and such other persons as may be
specified by the rules of the Tribunal. 1968-
69, c. 10, s. 16.

**17.** (1) The Deputy Minister, upon receipt
of an order or finding of the Tribunal, shall
make a final determination of dumping in
the case of any goods described in the said
order or finding that were entered into
Canada before the order or finding of the
Tribunal,
  * (_a_) by determining whether the goods are
goods described in the order or finding of
the Tribunal, and
  * (_b_) by appraising the normal value and
export price of the goods,
and subject to subsection 18(4) and subsection
19(1), such decision is final and conclusive.
(2) The Deputy Minister shall make his
final determination on the basis of such facts
and information as are available to him, and
upon the making of such determination shall
thereupon cause an assessment to be made of
the duty payable in respect of any goods
affected thereby.
(3) The Deputy Minister shall give notice
his final determination in the manner
Gazette. 1968-69, c. 10, s. 17.

**18.** (1) Subject to this Act, where, subse
quent to an order or finding of the Tribunal,
any goods are entered into Canada,
  * (_a_) a determination as to whether the
entered goods are goods of the same
description as the goods or description of
goods to which the order or finding applies,
and
  * (_b_) an appraisal of the normal value and
export price of the entered goods,
made upon the entry is final and conclusive
unless the importer, within 90 days from the
making thereof, makes a written request in a
prescribed form and in a manner prescribed
by the regulations to a Dominion customs
appraiser for a re-determination or a re
appraisal.
(2) A Dominion customs appraiser may re-
determine any determination of the descrip-
tion or re-appraise any appraisal of the
normal value or export price of any goods
made pursuant to subsection (1),
  * (_a_) in accordance with a request made
pursuant to subsection (1) ; or
  * (_b_) in any other case, where he deems it
advisable within two years of the date of
entry of the goods.
(3) Subject to subsection (4), a decision of a
Dominion customs appraiser under this section
is final and conclusive unless the importer,
within 90 days of the date of the decision,
makes a written request in a prescribed form
and in a manner prescribed by the regulations
to the Deputy Minister for a re-determination
or a re-appraisal.
(4) The Deputy Minister may re-determine
any determination of the description or re
appraise any appraisal of the normal value
or export price of any goods
  * (_a_) in accordance with a request made
pursuant to subsection (3) ;
(6) at any time, if the importer or exporter
has made any misrepresentation or com
mitted a fraud in entering the goods ;
  * (_c_) at any time, for the purpose of giving
effect to a decision of the Tariff Board, the
Exchequer Court of Canada or the Supreme
Court of Canada with respect to those
goods; and
  * (_d_) in any other case, where he deems it
advisable within two years of the date of
the entry of those goods.
(5) Where, in accordance with this section,
a re-determination as to whether any goods
are goods as described in paragraph (l)(a) or
