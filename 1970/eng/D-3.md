twenty years service is entitled to a pension
for life equal to the greater of

year by which his age at the time of his
retirement is less than the prescribed age
limit for his rank, and

entitled under subsection (2);

the garrisons of Halifax and Esquimalt,
subject to the provisions hereinafter contained
as to deductions from the pension in cases
where an officer becomes entitled to a pension
and the deduction hereinafter provided for
has not been made for as great a number of
years as that upon which his pension is based.
(9) Any officer who is or has been seconded
shall, during the time that he is seconded,
continue to contribute, from time to time, to
the Consolidated Revenue Fund, sums equal
to the deductions that would have been made
from his pay if he had not been seconded,
and he is in such case, upon his retirement
from the force, entitled, subject to this Act, to
the pension that he would have received if he
had continued to serve in the force until the
time of his retirement.
(10) In the case of an officer who has been
in any other military force raised in Canada
for service outside Canada and paid and
maintained by the Government of Canada,
or who has been permitted to serve in any
such force, deductions at the rate of five per
cent per annum shall be made from the salary
or pay, as the case may be, which such officer
is receiving in the public service or as an
officer in any such force, and those deductions
shall form part of the Consolidated Revenue
Fund and shall be treated in all respects as
deductions under this Act ; and, notwithstand
ing anything in this Act, the pension granted
an officer thus seconded, or thus serving in

deductions under this Act, and as satisfying
the contributions that such officer is, by
subsections (9) and (10), required to make.
(12) The pension to which any s.uch officer
may become entitled shall be computed in
respect of the average annual pay and
allowances or salary and allowances of which
he was in receipt while serving in the force,

Canada, as the case may be, during the three
years immediately preceding his retirement
from the force.

in naval, army or air force employment, or is
seconded, shall be computed on the average
annual amount of the pay and allowances
received by him during the last three years
while serving as a member or associate member
of the Defence Council, if a pension computed
in such manner would be more beneficial to
the officer than if computed as otherwise
provided by this Act. R.S., c. 63, s. 3; R.S., c.
310, s. 4 ; 1959, c. 21 , s. 33 ; 1966-67, c. 44, s. 57.

of Canada that was of such a nature as could
be reckoned in computing the period of service
for purposes of a superannuation allowance
under that Act had the officer remained in
the public service and had elected to become
a contributor under any part of that Act, may
be included in the term of service of an officer
for the purposes of this Act.

provided for in this section has not been made
for as great a number of years as that upon
which his pension is based, the aggregate
amount of pay received by him during the
years for which no such deduction has been
made, shall be divided by the number of such
years for the purpose of ascertaining the
average pay of such officer during such years,

medical board constituted in accordance with
regulations made under the National Defence
Act shall certify that such militiaman is so
incapacitated and that the incapacity is likely
to be permanent.

time he declines so to serve or when serving
again he neglects while he is in a competent
state of health to perform his duty satisfac
torily, he shall forfeit his pension. R.S., c. 63,
s. 18.

**19.** A militiaman so serving again is
entitled to retire at the same time as he would

renewal of his service were service, but the
time so elapsed shall not be reckoned as
service in calculating his pension on his final
retirement. R.S., c. 63, s. 19.

**20.** (1) Where a militiaman fails or refuses,
when required, to be examined by a legally
qualified medical practitioner, the Minister

that the incapacity of such militiaman had
ceased.
(2) In such case the Minister may with the
approval of the Governor in Council declare
forfeited the pension of such militiaman.
R.S., c. 63, s. 20.

militiaman on account of infirmity of mind
or body, and such infirmity is certified by a
medical board constituted as aforesaid, to
have been brought about or contributed to by
his own fault, or by his vicious habits, and
such militiaman is entitled under this Act to
a pension of a fixed amount, the Governor in
Council may grant to him a less amount of
pension than the amount to which he would
otherwise have been entitled. R.S., c. 63, s. 21.

**22.** A pension to a militiaman shall become
forfeited, and may be withdrawn,
  * (_a_) if the grantee is convicted of an
indictable offence ;

of the pension or compassionate allowance.

ranks corresponding to those he held from
time to time in the Canadian Military Forces
until the date he was struck off the strength
of the Canadian Expeditionary Force, such
pension to commence as of and from the date
following that on which such officer or
militiaman was struck off the strength of the
Canadian Expeditionary Force.
(2) An officer or militiaman to whom
subsection (1) applies, shall be required to
elect whether he shall be granted the pension
therein mentioned, and if he so elects his
service from the date of his enlistment in the
Force while belonging to the said Army
Reserve until the date he was struck off the
strength of the Canadian Expeditionary
Force, shall not be included in the term of
service for any other pension or a gratuity
under this Act ; any gratuity or pension under
this Act granted to an officer or militiaman
prior to his so electing shall be re-computed
as of the date on which the pension mentioned
in subsection (1) commenced by excluding
from the term of service on which such
gratuity or pension was based the service first
mentioned in this subsection; if by the
exclusion of such service the officer or
militiaman has not sufficient service to entitle
him to a gratuity or pension, or the gratuity
pension to which he would be entitled on
re-computation is less than the gratuity
pension heretofore granted, there will be
from the pension payable to such
or militiaman, under subsection (1), all
payments of gratuity and pension or over
payments thereof which have resulted ; but if
an officer who has already been granted a
pension under this Act elects as aforesaid,
and by the exclusion of the service mentioned
he becomes ineligible for the grant of such
pension, but becomes eligible for the payment
of a gratuity under this Act, then such
gratuity shall be applied toward the recovery
of the payments of pension already made,
and any balance of such payments not met
by the application of such gratuity shall be
recovered from the pension payable to such
officer under subsection (1). R.S., c. 63, s. 32.

Statutes of Canada, 1919, being An Act to
amend the Militia Pension Act, which came

reason of wounds or disabilities received or
suffered while on active service during the
war between Great Britain and Germany,
which commenced on the 4th day of August
1914, were retired or discharged from the force
prior to the said 7th day of July 1919, and an
officer who, by reason of such retirement
before a period at which a pension might
have been granted him, received a gratuity
and who will by virtue of this section, become
eligible for the grant of a pension under this
Act, shall be required to elect whether he shall
be granted such pension and if he so elects he
shall repay such gratuity in such manner as
the Governor in Council may determine. R.S.,
c. 63, s. 33.

**35.** When the Canadian Pension Commis
sion is of the opinion that the pensioner is
incapable of expending or is not expending
the pension in a proper manner, or that he is
not maintaining the members of his family to
he owes the duty of maintenance, the
Minister may order that the pension be paid
that the money may be expended by such
person, for the benefit of the pensioner and
the members of his family; the expenses
connected with such payment, if any, shall be
paid by the Commission. R.S., c. 63, s. 34.
