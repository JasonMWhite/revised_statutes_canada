British subject, a citizen or subject of a foreign
country that has adhered to the Convention
and the Additional Protocol thereto set out

tion and the Additional Protocol thereto, set
out in Schedule II, grants or has undertaken
to grant, either by treaty, convention, agree
ment or law, to citizens of Canada the benefit
of copyright on substantially the same basis
as to its own citizens or copyright protection
substantially equal to that conferred by this
Act, such country shall, for the purpose of the
rights conferred by this Act, be treated as if
it were a country to which this Act extends ;
and the Minister may give such a certificate
as aforesaid, notwithstanding that the reme
dies for enforcing the rights, or the restrictions

musical work, or an engraving, in which
copyright subsists at the date of the death of
the author or, in the case of a work of joint

of the death of the author who dies last, but
which has not been published, nor, in the case
of a dramatic or musical work, been performed
in public, nor, in the case of a lecture, been
delivered in public, before that date, copyright
shall subsist until publication, or performance
or delivery in public, whichever may first
happen, and for a term of fifty years
thereafter, and the provisions of section 7
relating to the reproduction of a published
work, after the death of the author, in the
case of works mentioned in this section, apply
as if the author had died at the date of such
publication, performance or delivery in public
as aforesaid. R.S., c. 55, s. 6.

years, or in the case of a work in which
copyright subsisted on the 4th day of June
1921, thirty years, from the death of the
author of a published work, copyright in the
work shall not be deemed to be infringed by
the reproduction of the work for sale if the
person reproducing the work proves that he
has given the prescribed notice in writing of
his intention to reproduce the work, and that
he has paid in the prescribed manner to, or
for the benefit of, the owner of the copyright,
royalties in respect of all copies of the work
sold by him, calculated at the rate of ten per
cent on the price at which he publishes the
work.
(2) For the purposes of this section, the
Governor in Council may make regulations
prescribing the mode in which notices are to

such notices, and the mode, time, and
frequency of the payment of royalties,
including, if he thinks fit, regulations requir
ing payment in advance or otherwise securing
the payment of royalties. U.S., c. 55, s. 7.

**8.** (1) In the case of a work of joint
authorship, copyright shall subsist during the
life of the author who dies last and for a term
of fifty years after his death, and references
in this Act to the period after the expiration
of any specified number of years from the
death of the author shall be construed as
references to the period after the expiration
of the like number of years from the death of
the author who dies last, and in the provisions
of this Act with respect to the grant of
compulsory licences a reference to the date of
the death of the author who dies last shall be
substituted for the date of the death of the
author.
(2) Authors who are nationals of any
country that grants a term of protection

are not entitled to claim a longer term of
protection in Canada. R.S., c. 55, s. 8.

of the photograph so derived, and, where such
owner is a body corporate, the body corporate
shall be deemed for the purposes of this Act
to reside within Her Majesty s Realms and
Territories if it has established a place of
business therein. R.S., c. 55, s. 9.

**10.** The term for which copyright shall
subsist in records, perforated rolls and other
contrivances by means of which sounds may
be mechanically reproduced shall be fifty
years from the making of the original plate
from which the contrivance was directly or
indirectly derived, and the person who was
the owner of such original plate at the time
when such plate was made shall be deemed to
be the author of such contrivance, and where
such owner is a body corporate, the body
corporate shall be deemed for the purposes of
this Act to reside within Her Majesty s Realms
and Territories if it has established a place of
business therein. R.S., c. 55, s. 10.

**11.** Without prejudice to any rights or
privileges of the Crown, where any work is, or
has been, prepared or published by or under
the direction or control of Her Majesty or any
government department, the copyright in the
work shall, subject to any agreement with the
author, belong to Her Majesty and in such
case shall continue for a period of fifty years
from the date of the first publication of the
work. R.S., c. 55, s. 11.

## OWNERSHIP OF COPYRIGHT

**12.** (1) Subject to this Act, the author of a
work shall be the first owner of the copyright
therein.
(2) Where, in the case of an engraving,
photograph, or portrait, the plate or other
original was ordered by some other person
and was made for valuable consideration in
pursuance of that order, then in the absence
of any agreement to the contrary, the person
by whom such plate or other original was
ordered shall be the first owner of the
copyright.
(3) Where the author was in the employment
of some other person under a contract of
or apprenticeship and the work was
in the course of his employment by that
the person by whom the author was
shall, in the absence of any
agreement to the contrary, be the first owner
of the copyright ; but where the work is an
article or other contribution to a newspaper,
magazine, or similar periodical, there shall,
in the absence of any agreement to the
contrary, be deemed to be reserved to the
author a right to restrain the publication of
the work, otherwise than as part of a
newspaper, magazine, or similar periodical.
(4) The owner of the copyright in any work
may assign the right, either wholly or
partially, and either generally or subject to
territorial limitations, and either for the whole
term of the copyright or for any other part
thereof, and may grant any interest in the
right by licence, but no such assignment or
grant is valid unless it is in writing signed by
the owner of the right in respect of which the
assignment or grant is made, or by his duly
authorized agent.
(5) Where the author of a work is the first
owner of the copyright therein, no assignment
of the copyright, and no grant of any interest
therein, made by him, otherwise than by will,
after the 4th day of June 1921, is operative to
vest in the assignee or grantee any rights with
respect to the copyright in the work beyond
the expiration of twenty-five years from the
death of the author, and the reversionary
interest in the copyright expectant on the
termination of that period shall, on the death
of the author, notwithstanding any agreement
to the contrary, devolve on his legal represent
atives as part of his estate, and any agreement
entered into by him as to the disposition of
such reversionary interest is void ; but nothing
in this subsection shall be construed as
applying to the assignment of the copyright
in a collective work or a licence to publish a
work or part of a work as part of a collective
work.
(6) Where, under any partial assignment of
copyright, the assignee becomes entitled to
any right comprised in copyright, the assignee,
as respects the rights so assigned, and the
assignor, as respects the rights not assigned,
shall be treated for the purposes of this Act
as the owner of the copyright, and this Act
effect accordingly.
(7) Independently of the author s copyright ,
and even after the assignment, either wholly
or partially, of the said copyright, the author
has the right to claim authorship of the work,
as well as the right to restrain any distortion,
mutilation or other modification of the work
that would be prejudicial to his honour or
reputation. R.S., c. 55, s. 12.

## COMPULSORY LICENCES

**13.** Where, at any time after the death of
the author of a literary, dramatic, or musical
work that has been published or performed in
public, a complaint is made to the Governor
in Council that the owner of the copyright in
the work has refused to republish or to allow
the republication of the work or has refused
to allow the performance in public of the
work, and that by reason of such refusal the
work is withheld from the public, the owner
of the copyright may be ordered to grant a
licence to reproduce the work or perform the
work in public, as the case may be, on such
terms and subject to such conditions as the
Governor in Council may think fit. R.S., c.
55, s. 13.

[The following is an English translation of the Convention
with the omission of the formal beginning and end.]
Article 1
The Contracting States are constituted into a Union for the
protection of the rights of authors over their literary and
artistic works.
Article 2
The expression "literary and artistic works" shall include any
production in the literary, scientific or artistic domain, whatever
may be the mode or form of its reproduction, such as books,
pamphlets, and other writings, dramatic or dramatico-musical
works, choreographic works and entertainments in dumb show,
the acting form of which is fixed in writing or otherwise ; musical
compositions with or without words ; works of drawing, painting,
architecture, sculpture, engraving and lithography ; illustrations,
geographical charts; plans, sketches, and plastic works relative
to geography, topography, architecture or science.
Translations, adaptations, arrangements of music and other
reproductions in an altered form of a literary or artistic work
as well as collections of different works, shall be protected as
original works without prejudice to the rights of the author of
the original work.
The contracting countries shall be bound to make provision
for the protection of the above-mentioned works.
Works of art applied to industrial purposes shall be protected
so far as the domestic legislation of each country allows.
Article 3
The present Convention shall apply to photographic works
of origin of the work, for their works, whether unpublished or
first published in a country of the Union, the rights which the
respective laws do now or may hereafter grant to natives as
well as the rights specially granted by the present Convention.
The enjoyment and the exercise of these rights shall not be
subject to the performance of any formality; such enjoyment
and such exercise are independent of the existence of protection
in the country of origin of the work. Consequently, apart from
the express stipulations of the present Convention, the extent
of protection, as well as the means of redress secured to the
author to safeguard his rights, shall be governed exclusively by
the laws of the country where protection is claimed.
The country of origin of the work shall be considered to be:
in the case of unpublished works, the country to which the
author belongs; in the case of published works, the country of
first publication; and in the case of works published simul
taneously in several countries of the Union, the country the
laws of which grant the shortest term of protection. In the case
of works published simultaneously in a country outside the
Union and in a country of the Union, the latter country shall
be considered exclusively as the country of origin.
By published works must be understood, for the purposes of
the present Convention, works copies of which have been issued
to the public. The representation of a dramatic or dramatico-
musical work, the performance of a musical work, the exhibi
tion of a work of art, and the construction of a work of archi
tecture shall not constitute a publication.
Article 5
Authors being subjects or citizens of one of the countries of
the Union who first publish their works in another country of
the Union shall have in the latter country the same rights as
native authors.
Article 6
Authors not being subjects or citizens of one of the countries
of the Union, who first publish their works in one of those
countries, shall enjoy in that country the same rights as native
authors, and in the other countries of the Union the rights
granted by the present Convention.
Article 7
The term of protection granted by the present Convention
shall include the life of the author and fifty years after his
death.
Nevertheless, in case such term of protection should not be
uniformly adopted by all the countries of the Union, the term
shall be regulated by the law of the country where protection
is claimed, and must not exceed the term fixed in the country
of origin of the work. Consequently the contracting countries
shall only be bound to apply the provisions of the preceding
paragraph in so far as such provisions are consistent with their
domestic laws.
For photographic works and works produced by a process
analogous to photography, for posthumous works, for anony
mous or pseudonymous works, the term of protection shall be
regulated by the law of the country where protection is claimed,
provided that the said term shall not exceed the term fixed in
the country of origin of the work.
Article 8
The authors of unpublished works, being subjects or citizens
of one of the countries of the Union, and the authors of works
first published in one of those countries shall enjoy, in the other
countries of the Union, during the whole term of the right in
the original work, the exclusive right of making or authorizing
a translation of their works.
Article 9
Serial stories, tales, and all other works, whether literary,
scientific, or artistic, whatever their object, published in the
newspapers or periodicals of one of the countries of the Union
may not be reproduced in the other countries without the
consent of the authors.
With the exception of serial stories, and tales any newspaper
article may be reproduced by another newspaper unless the
reproduction thereof is expressly forbidden. Nevertheless, the
source must be indicated; the legal consequences of the breach
of this obligation shall be determined by the laws of the country
where protection is claimed.
The protection of the present Convention shall not apply to
news of the day or to miscellaneous information which is simply
of the nature of items of news.
Article 10
As regards the liberty of extracting portions from literary or
artistic works for use in publication destined for educational
purposes, or having a scientific character, or for chrestomathies,
the effect of the legislation of the countries of the Union and of
special Arrangements existing or to be concluded between them
is not affected by the present Convention.
Article 11
The stipulations of the present Convention shall apply to the
public representation of dramatic or dramatico-musical works,
and to the public performance of musical works, whether such
works be published or not.
Authors of dramatic or dramatico-musical works shall be
protected during the existence of their right over the original
work against the unauthorized public representation of transla
tions of their works.
In order to enjoy the protection of the present Article,
authors shall not be bound in publishing their works to forbid
the public representation or performance thereof.
Article 12
The following shall be specially included among the unlawful
reproductions to which the present Convention applies: Un
authorized indirect appropriations of a literary or artistic work,
such as adaptations, musical arrangements, transformations of a
novel, tale, or piece of poetry into a dramatic piece and vice
versa, etc., when they are only the reproduction of that work,
in the same form or in another form without essential altera
tions, additions, or abridgements, and do not present the
character of a new original work.
Article IS
The authors of musical works shall have the exclusive right
of authorizing (1) the adaptation of those works to instruments
which can reproduce them mechanically; (2) the public per
of the present Convention.
Adaptations made in virtue of paragraphs 2 and 3 of the
present Article, and imported without the authority of the
interested parties into a country where they would not be law
ful, shall be liable to seizure in that country.
Article 14
Authors of literary, scientific or artistic works shall have the
exclusive right of authorizing the reproduction and public repre
sentation of their works by cinematography.
Cinematograph productions shall be protected as literary or
artistic works, if, by the arrangement of the acting form or the
combinations of the incidents represented, the author has given
the work a personal and original character.
Without prejudice to the rights of the author of the original
work the reproduction by cinematography of a literary, scien
tific or artistic work shall be protected as an original work.
The above provisions apply to reproduction or production
effected by any other process analogous to cinematography.
Article 16
In order that the authors of works protected by the present
Convention shall, in the absence of proof to the contrary, be
considered as such, and be consequently admitted to institute
proceedings against pirates before the Courts of the various
countries of the Union, it will be sufficient that their name be
indicated on the work in the accustomed manner.
For anonymous or pseudonymous works the publisher, whose
name is indicated on the work, shall be entitled to protect the
rights belonging to the author. He shall be, without other proof,
deemed to be the legal representative of the anonymous or
pseudonymous author.
Article 16
Pirated works may be seized by the competent authorities
of any country of the Union where the original work enjoys
legal protection.
In such a country the seizure may also apply to reproduc
tions imported from a country where the work is not protected,
or has ceased to be protected.
The seizure shall take place in accordance with the domestic
legislation of each country.
Article 17
The provisions of the present Convention cannot in any way
derogate from the right belonging to the Government of each
country of the Union to permit, to control, or to prohibit, by
means of domestic legislation or police, the circulation, repre
sentation, or exhibition of any works or productions in regard
to which the competent authority may find it necessary to
exercise that right.
Article 18
The present Convention shall apply to all works which at the
moment of its coming into force have not yet fallen into the
public domain in the country of origin through the expiration
of the term of protection.
If, however, through the expiration of the term of protection
which was previously granted, a work has fallen into the public
domain of the country where protection is claimed, that work
shall not be protected anew in that country.
The application of this principle shall take effect according to
the stipulations contained in special Conventions existing, or
to be concluded, to that effect between countries of the Union.
In the absence of such stipulations, the respective countries
shall regulate, each in so far as it is concerned, the manner in
which the said principle is to be applied.
The above provisions shall apply equally in case of new
accessions to the Union, and also in the event of the term of
protection being extended by the application of Article 7.
Article 19
The provisions of the present Convention shall not prevent
a claim being made for the application of any wider provisions
which may be made by the legislation of a country of the
Union in favour of foreigners in general.
Article SO
The Governments of the countries of the Union reserve to
themselves the right to enter into special arrangements between
each other, provided always that such arrangements confer upon
authors more extended rights than those granted by the Union,
or embody other stipulations not contrary to the present Con
vention. The provisions of existing arrangements which answer
to the above-mentioned conditions shall remain applicable.
Article 21
The International Office established under the name of the
"Office of the International Union for the Protection of
Literary and Artistic Works" shall be maintained.
That office is placed under the high authority of the Govern
ment of the Swiss Confederation, which regulates its organiza
tion and supervises its working.
The official language of the Office shall be French.
Article 22
The International Office collects every kind of information
relative to the protection of the rights of authors over then-
literary and artistic works. It arranges and publishes such in
formation. It undertakes the study of questions of general
interest concerning the Union, and by the aid of documents
placed at its disposal by the different administrations, edits a
periodical publication in the French language on the questions
which concern the objects of the Union. The Governments of
the countries of the Union reserve to themselves the power to
authorize by common accord the publication by the Office of an
edition in one or more other languages, if experience should
show this to be requisite.
The International Office will always hold itself at the disposal
of members of the Union with a view to furnish them with any
special information which they may require relative to the
protection of literary and artistic works.
The Director of the International Office shall make an
annual Report on his Administration, which shall be com
to all the members of the Union.
Article 23
The expenses of the Office of the International Union shall
shared by the contracting States. Until a fresh arrangement
be made they cannot exceed the sum of 60,000 francs a year.
This sum may be increased, if necessary, by the simple decision
of one of the Conferences provided for in Article 24.
The share of the total expense to be paid by each country
shall be determined by the division of the contracting and
acceding countries into six classes, each of which shall contribute
in the proportion of a certain number of units, viz.:
Units
1st class 25
2nd class 20
3rd class 15
4th class 10
5th class 5
6th class 3
These coefficients are multiplied by the number of countries
of each class, and the total product thus obtained gives the
number of units by which the total expense is to be divided.
The quotient gives the amount of the unit of expense.
Each country shall declare, at the time of its accession, in
which of the said classes it desires to be placed.
The Swiss Administration prepares the Budget of the Office,
superintends its expenditure, makes the necessary advances,
and draws up the annual account which shall be communicated
to all the other Administrations.
Article 24
The present Convention may be submitted to revisions in
order to introduce therein amendments calculated to perfect
the system of the Union.
Questions of this kind, as well as those which are of interest
to the Union in other respects, shall be considered in Con
ferences to be held successively in the countries of the Union
by delegates of the said countries. The Administration of the
country where a Conference is to meet prepares, with the assist
ance of the International Office, the programme of the Con
ference. The Director of the Office shall attend at the sittings
of the Conferences, and shall take part in the discussions with
out the right to vote.
No alteration in the present Convention shall be binding on
the Union except by the unanimous consent of the countries
composing it.
Article 25
States outside the Union which make provision for the legal
protection of the rights forming the object of the present Con
vention may accede thereto on request to that effect.
Such accession shall be notified in writing to the Government
of the Swiss Confederation, who will communicate it to all the
other countries of the Union.
Such accession shall imply full adhesion to all the clauses and
admission to all the advantages provided by the present Con
vention. It may, nevertheless, contain an indication of the
provisions of the Convention of the 9th September, 1886, or of
They may do this either by a general Declaration comprising
the accession all their Colonies or possessions, or by specially
those comprised therein, or by simply indicating those
which are excluded.
Such Declaration shall be notified in writing to the Govern
ment of the Swiss Confederation, who will communicate it to
all the other countries of the Union.
Article 27
The present Convention shall replace, in regard to the rela
tions between the Contracting States, the Convention of Berne
of the 9th September, 1886, including the Additional Article
and the Final Protocol of the same date, as well as the Addi
tional Act and the Interpretative Declaration of the 4th May,

**1896.** These instruments shall remain in force in regard to rela
tions with States which do not ratify the present Convention.
The Signatory States of the present Convention may declare
at the exchange of ratifications that they desire to remain

Swiss Confederation. It shall only take effect in regard to the
country making it, the Convention remaining in full force and
effect for the other countries of the Union.
Article SO

## SCHEDULE III

## THE ROME COPYRIGHT CONVENTION, 1928
The International Convention for the protection of literary
and artistic works signed at Berne on the 9th September, 1886,
and revised at Berlin on the 13th November, 1908, was jurther
revised by the Copyright Convention which was signed at
Rome on the 2nd June, 1928.
[The following is an English translation of the Convention
signed at Rome with the omission of the formal beginning
and end.]
Article 1
The countries to which the present convention applies are
constituted into a Union for the protection of the rights of
authors over their literary and artistic works.
Article 2
(1) The term "literary and artistic works" shall include every
production in the literary, scientific and artistic domain, what
ever may be the mode or form of its expression, such as books,
pamphlets and other writings; lectures, addresses, sermons and
(2) Translations, adaptations, arrangements of music and
other reproductions in an altered form of a literary or artistic
work, as well as collections of different works, shall be pro
tected as original works without prejudice to the rights of the
author of the original work.
(3) The countries of the Union shall be bound to make
provision for the protection of the above-mentioned works.
(4) Works of ait applied to industrial purposes shall be pro
tected so far as the domestic legislation of each country allows.

speeches and speeches delivered in legal proceedings from the
protection provided by the preceding article is reserved for the
domestic legislation of each country of the Union.
(2) The right of fixing the conditions under which lectures,
addresses, sermons and other works of the same nature may be
reproduced by the press is also reserved for the domestic legis
lation of each country of the Union. Nevertheless the author
shall have the sole right of making a collection of the said
works.
Article 3
The present Convention shall apply to photographic works
and to works produced by a process analogous to photography.
The countries of the Union shall be bound to make provision
for their protection.
Article 4
(1) Authors who are nationals of any of the countries of the
Union shall enjoy in countries other than the country of origin
of the work, for their works, whether unpublished or first
published in a country of the Union, the rights which the
respective laws do now or may hereafter grant to natives, as
well as the rights specially granted by the present Convention.
(2) The enjoyment and the exercise of these rights shall not
be subject to the performance of any formality; such enjoy
ment and such exercise are independent of the existence of
protection in the country of origin of the work. Consequently,
apart from the express stipulations of the present Convention,
the extent of protection, as well as the means of redress secured
to the author to safeguard his rights, shall be governed exclu
sively by the laws of the country where protection is claimed.
(3) The country of origin of the work shall be considered to
be: in the case of unpublished works, the country to which the
author belongs; in the case of published works, the country of
first publication; and in the case of works published simul
taneously in several countries of the Union, the country the
laws of which grant the shortest term of protection. In the case
of works published simultaneously in a country outside the
and in a country of the Union, the latter country shall
considered exclusively as the country of origin.
(4) By "published works" must be understood, for the pur-
the exhibition of a of art, the construction of a work
of architecture shall not constitute a publication.
Article 5
Authors who are nationals of one of the countries of the
Union and who first publish their works in another country of
the Union shall have in the latter country the same rights as
native authors.
Article 6
(1) Authors who are not nationals of one of the countries of
the Union, and who first publish their works in one of those
countries, shall enjoy in that country the same rights as native
authors, and in the other countries of the Union the rights
granted by the present Convention.
(2) Nevertheless, where any country outside the Union fails
to protect in an adequate manner the works of authors who
are nationals of one of the countries of the Union, the latter
country may restrict the protection given to the works of
authors who are at the date of the first publication thereof
nationals of the other country and are not effectively domi
ciled in one of the countries of the Union.
(3) No restrictions introduced by virtue of the preceding
paragraph shall in any way affect the rights which an author
may have acquired in respect of a work published in a country
of the Union before such restrictions were put in force.
(4) The countries of the Union which restrict the grant of
copyright in accordance with the present article shall give
notice thereof to the Government of the Swiss Confederation
by a written declaration specifying the countries in regard to
which protection is restricted and the restrictions to which
rights of authors who are nationals of those countries are
subjected. The Government of the Swiss Confederation will
immediately communicate this declaration to all the countries
of the Union.
Article 6 (bis)
(1) Independently of the author s copyright, and even after
transfer of the said copyright, the author shall have the right
to claim authorship of the work, as well as the right to object
to any distortion, mutilation or other modification of the said
work which would be prejudicial to his honour or reputation.
(2) The determination of the conditions under which these
rights shall be exercised is reserved for the national legislation
of the countries of the Union. The means of redress for safe
guarding these rights shall be regulated by the legislation of the
country where protection is claimed.
Article 7
(1) The term of protection granted by the present Con
vention shall be the life of the author and fifty years after
his death.
(2) Nevertheless, in case such term of protection should not
be uniformly adopted by all the countries of the Union, the
term shall be regulated by the law of the country where pro
tection is claimed, and must not exceed the term fixed in the
country of origin of the work. Consequently the countries of
the Union shall only be bound to apply the provisions of the
preceding paragraph in so far as such provisions are consistent
with their domestic laws.
(3) For photographic works and works produced by a process
analogous to photography, for posthumous works, for anony
mous or pseudonymous works, the term of protection shall be
regulated by the law of the country where protection is
claimed, provided that the said term shall not exceed the term
fixed in the country of origin of the work.
Article 7 (bis)
(1) The term of copyright protection belonging in common
to joint authors of a work shall be calculated according to the
date of the death of the author who dies last.
(2) Authors who are nationals of the countries which grant
a term of protection shorter than that mentioned in para
graph (1) cannot claim a longer term of protection in the
other countries of the Union.
(3) In no case may the term of protection expire before the
death of the author who dies last.
Article 8
The authors of unpublished works, who are nationals of one
of the countries of the Union, and the authors of works first
published in one of those countries, shall enjoy, in the other
countries of the Union, during the whole term of the right in
the original work, the exclusive right of making or authorizing
