time, without leave and without sufficient
reason, from his vessel, or from his duty,
not amounting to desertion, to imprison
ment for any term not exceeding four weeks
for quitting the vessel without leave

wages a sum not exceeding ten days pay ;

the commissioner or justice, to forfeit out
of his wages a sum not exceeding two days
pay;
  * (_e_) for continued wilful disobedience to
lawful commands, or continued wilful
neglect of duty, to imprisonment for any

or the continuance of the cruise, to
imprisonment for any term not exceeding
four weeks, with or without hard labour ;
and
  * (_h_) for wilfully damaging the vessel, or
embezzling or wilfully damaging any of its
stores, to forfeit out of his wages a sum
equal in amount to the loss thereby

commissioner or justice, to imprisonment
for any term not exceeding four weeks, with
or without hard labour. R.S., c. 137, s. 9.

**10.** (1) Upon the commission of any of the
offences enumerated in section 9, an entry
thereof shall be made in the log-book, and
shall be signed by the master and also by one
of the officers or one of the crew.
(2) The offender, if still in the vessel, shall
before the next subsequent arrival of the
vessel at any port, or, if it is at the time in
port, before its departure therefrom, be
furnished with a copy of such entry, and have
the same read over distinctly and audibly to
him, and may thereupon make such reply
thereto as he thinks fit.
(3) A statement that a copy of the entry
has been so furnished, and that it has been so
read over as aforesaid, and the reply, if any,
made by the offender, shall likewise be
entered and signed in the manner aforesaid.
(4) In any subsequent legal proceeding, the
entries hereinbefore required shall, if practi
cable, be produced and proved, and, in default
of such production and proof, the commis
sioner or justice hearing the case may, in his
discretion, refuse to receive evidence of the
offence. R.S., c. 137, s. 10.
LI. (1) Whenever, either at the commence
ment or during the progress of any voyage or
cruise, any person subject to this Act neglects
or refuses to join, or deserts from, or refuses
to proceed on any voyage or cruise in any
vessel belonging to the Government of Canada
in which he is duly engaged to serve, or is
found otherwise absenting himself therefrom
without leave, the master or any officer of
such vessel may, in any place in Canada, with
or without the assistance of the police
constables, apprehend him without first
procuring a warrant, and may in any case,
and shall, when that person so requires, if
practicable, convey him before a commissioner
or before some justice of the peace, to be dealt
with according to law.
(2) The master or other officer may, if that
person does not require himself to be conveyed
before a commissioner or justice, or if he does
so require, and such course is impracticable
by reason of there being no commissioner or
justice at or near the place where the person
is apprehended, at once convey the person on
such vessel ; or the master or other
officer may, for the purpose of conveying the
person before a commissioner or justice, detain
him in custody for a period not exceeding
twenty-four hours.
(3) Every police constable shall, when
requested to do so, assist any master or officer
of a vessel belonging to the Government in
apprehending any person offending against
this Act.
(4) Where any such apprehension appears
to the commissioner or justice before whom
the case is brought to have been made on
improper or insufficient grounds, the master
or officer who makes the apprehension or
causes it to be made, shall incur a penalty
not exceeding one hundred dollars ; but such
penalty, if inflicted, is a bar to any action for
false imprisonment in respect of the appre
hension. R.S.,c. 137, s. 11.

**12.** (1) Whenever a person subject to this
Act is brought before any commissioner, or
justice of the peace, on the ground of his
having neglected or refused to join or proceed
on any voyage or cruise in any vessel
belonging to the Government of Canada in
which he is engaged to serve, or of having
deserted or otherwise absented himself there
from without leave, such commissioner or
justice may, if the master or any officer
thereof so requires, instead of committing the
offender to prison, cause him to be conveyed
on board for the purpose of proceeding on the
voyage or cruise, or deliver him to the master
or any officer of the vessel, to be by him so
conveyed.
(2) The commissioner or justice may in such
case order any costs and expenses properly
incurred by or on behalf of the master, by
reason of the offence, to be paid by the
offender, and, if necessary, to be deducted
from any wages that he has then earned, or
that by virtue of his then existing engagement
he may afterwards earn. R.S., c. 137, s. 12.

**13.** Where any person subject to this Act is
the Government of Canada in which he is
to serve, or of his having deserted or
absented himself therefrom without
or of his having committed any other
of discipline, and, where during such
imprisonment, and before his engagement is
at an end, his services are required on board
his vessel, any justice of the peace may, at
the request of the master or of any officer
thereof, cause such person to be conveyed on
board his said vessel for the purpose of
proceeding on the voyage or cruise, or to be
delivered to the master or any officer of the
same, to be by him so conveyed, notwith
standing that the term for which he was
sentenced to imprisonment has not expired.
R.S., c. 137, s. 13.

**14.** (1) Whenever a question arises, whether
the wages of any person subject to this Act
are forfeited for desertion, it is sufficient for
the person insisting on the forfeiture to show
that
  * (_a_) such person was duly engaged in, or
that he belonged to the vessel from which
he is alleged to have deserted ;
(6) he quitted such vessel before the com
pletion of the period of his engagement ;
and
  * (_c_) an entry of the desertion has been duly
made in the log-book.
(2) The desertion shall thereupon, as far as
relates to any forfeiture of wages or emolu
ments under the provisions hereinbefore
contained, be deemed to be proved, unless the
person can produce a proper certificate of
discharge, or can otherwise show to the
satisfaction of the commissioner or justice of
the peace hearing the case that he had
sufficient reason for leaving his vessel. R.S.,
c. 137, s. 14.

**15.** (1) Any justice of the peace for the
county or district in which is situated the port
where the vessel, on board of which any
offence against this Act has been committed,
touches next after the time of the commission
of the offence has jurisdiction over any such
offence.
