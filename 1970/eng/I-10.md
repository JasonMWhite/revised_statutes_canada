regulations, authorize the payment to the
corporation of a scientific research and
development grant in respect of those expen

tion as he considers relevant, is satisfied that
the scientific research and development in
respect of which the expenditure was made is
likely to result in benefit to Canada if it is
successful, and, where the Minister is not so
satisfied,
  * (_a_) no amount paid to the corporation in
respect of such scientific research and
development, and
(6) no property acquired by the corporation
