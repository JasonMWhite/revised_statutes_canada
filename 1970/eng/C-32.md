exchange drawn, accepted or endorsed, and
every promissory note and cheque made,
drawn or endorsed on behalf of the company,

authority as such agent, officer or servant, is
binding upon the company.

with him.
(4) The person affixing any such official
seal shall, by writing under his hand, on the
deed or other document to which the official
seal is affixed, certify the date and place of
affixing the same, but failure to do so does
not invalidate the deed or other document.
(5) A deed or other document to which an
official seal is duly affixed binds the company

the domicile of the company in Canada ; and

of shares held by him and the amount paid
up thereon, but, in respect of a share or shares
held jointly by several persons, the company
is not bound to issue more than one certificate,
and delivery of a certificate for a share to one
of several joint shareholders is sufficient
delivery to all.
(2) A company may by by-law provide that
the signatures of the officer or officers
designated to sign certificates may be
engraved, lithographed or otherwise mechani
cally reproduced upon certificates for shares,

the company for any dividend or money
payable in respect of such share whether
notice of such trust has been given to the
company or not.
(3) The company is not bound to see to the
application of the money paid upon such
receipt. R.S., c. 53, s. 34.

**38.** (1) A public company, if so authorized
by its letters patent or supplementary letters
patent and subject to the provisions respecting
share warrants therein contained, may, with
respect to any fully paid-up shares, issue
under the seal of the company a warrant
stating that the bearer of the warrant is
entitled to the share or shares therein specified,
and may provide by coupons or otherwise, for
the payment of the future dividends on the
share or shares included in the warrant,
hereinafter referred to as a "share warrant".
(2) A share warrant entitles the bearer
to the shares therein specified, and
the shares may be transferred by delivery of
the warrant.
(3) The bearer of a share warrant is, subject
to tne provisions and regulations respecting
share warrants contained in the letters patent
or supplementary letters patent, entitled, on
surrendering it for cancellation, to have his
name entered on the books of the company
as the holder of the shares specified in such
share warrant, and the company is responsible
for any loss incurred by any person by reason
of the company entering on its books the
name of the bearer of a share warrant in
respect of the shares therein specified without
the warrant being surrendered and cancelled.
(4) The bearer of a share warrant may, if
the provisions and regulations respecting
share warrants so provide, be deemed to be a
shareholder of the company either to the full
extent or for any purposes defined by such
regulations ; except that he shall not be
qualified in respect of the shares specified in
the warrant for being a director of the
company.
(5) Qn the issue of a share warrant the
company shall remove from its books the

  * (_b_) a statement of the shares included in
the warrant ; and
  * (_c_) the date of the issue of the warrant.

particulars specified in subsection (5) shall be
deemed to be the particulars required by this
Act to be entered in the books of the company
in respect of such share or shares, and, on the
surrender, the date of the surrender shall be
entered, as if it were the date at which a
person ceased to be a shareholder.
(7) Unless the bearer of a share warrant is
entitled to attend and vote at meetings of
shareholders, the shares represented by such
share warrant shall not be counted as part of
the capital stock of the company for the
purposes of any meeting of shareholders. R.S.,
c. 53, s. 35 ; 1964-65, c. 52, s. 19.
Transfer of Shares

**39.** (1) No transfer of shares, unless made
by sale under execution or under the decree,
order or judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction, is, until entry thereof has been
duly made in the register of transfers or in a
branch register of transfers of the company,
valid for any purpose whatsoever, save only
as exhibiting the rights of the parties thereto
toward each other, and if absolute of rendering
any transferee jointly and severally liable
with the transferor to the company and to its
creditors.
(2) Notwithstanding subsection (1), the
delivery of any certificate for fully paid
shares, with a duly executed transfer endorsed
thereon or delivered therewith, constitutes a
valid transfer of the shares comprised therein,
if such shares are listed on any recognized
stock exchange at the time of such delivery,
but, until entry of such transfer is duly made
in the register of transfers or in a branch
register of transfers of the company, the
company may treat the person in whose name
the shares comprised in the said certificate
stand on the books of the company as being
solely entitled to receive notice of and vote
at meetings of shareholders and to receive
any payments in respect of such shares
whether by way of dividends or otherwise.
R.S., c. 53, s. 36.

**40.** (1) No transfer of shares whereof the
whole amount has not been paid in shall be
made without the consent of the directors.
(2) Where any such transfer is made, with
the consent of the directors, to a person who
is not apparently of sufficient means to fully
pay up such shares, subject to subsection (3),
the directors are jointly and severally liable
to the company and its creditors in the same
manner and to the same extent as the
transferring shareholder, but for such transfer,
would have been liable.
(3) Where any director, present when any
such transfer is allowed, forthwith, or where
any director then absent, within one week
after he becomes aware of such transfer, and
is able to do so, delivers to the secretary or
officer of the company his written
protest against the transfer, and, within eight
days thereafter, causes such protest to be
notified by registered letter to the Minister,
such director shall thereby and not otherwise
exonerate himself from such liability.
(4) Where a share upon which a call is
unpaid is transferred with the consent of the
directors, the transferee is liable for the call
to the same extent and with the same liability
to forfeiture of the share, as if he had been
the holder when the call was made, and the
transferor also remains liable for the call until

votes cast at a special general meeting of
shareholders called for the purpose and
confirmed by supplementary letters patent.
(3) Notwithstanding anything contained in
this section, where pursuant to subsection
13(2) preferred shares are issued providing for
redemption or purchase for cancellation out
of capital, and such shares are so redeemed or
purchased for cancellation, then, upon the
filing of notice thereof with the Minister
pursuant to section 63, they are thereupon
cancelled, and the authorized and the issued
capital of the company shall be thereby
decreased ; and subsections (1) and (2) of this
section and sections 53 to 60 do not apply.
R.S., c. 53, s. 49; 1964-65, c. 52, s. 21.

**53.** (1) Where the proposed reduction of

in respect of unpaid capital or the payment
to any shareholder of any paid-up capital,
and in any other case if the Minister so
directs, every creditor of the company who at
the date of the petition for supplementary
letters patent is entitled to any debt or claim
that, if that date were the commencement of
the winding-up of the company, would be
admissible in proof against the company, is
entitled to object to the reduction.
(2) The Minister shall settle a list of
creditors so entitled to object, and for that
purpose shall ascertain, as far as possible
without requiring an application from any
creditor, the names of those creditors and the
nature and amount of their debts or claims,
and may publish notices fixing a day or days
within which creditors not entered on the list
are to claim to be so entered or are to be
excluded from the right of objecting to the
reduction.
(3) Where a creditor entered on the list
whose debt or claim is not discharged or
determined does not consent to the reduction,
the Minister may, if he thinks fit, dispense
with the consent of that creditor, on the
company securing payment of his debt or
claim by appropriating, as the Minister may
direct, the following amount, that is to say,
  * (_a_) if the company admits the full amount
of the debt or claim, or, though not
admitting it, is willing to provide for it,
then the full amount of the debt or claim ;
or
  * (_fe_) if the company does not admit and is
not willing to provide for the full amount
of the debt or claim, or if the amount is
contingent or not ascertained, then an
amount fixed by the Minister after the like

special circumstances of the case he thinks
proper so to do, direct that this section shall
not apply as regards any class or any classes
of creditors. R.S., c. 53, s. 51.

officer of the company that either each such
creditor s consent to the reduction has been
obtained or his debt or claim has been
discharged, determined or secured. 1964-65, c.

call or contribution, notwithstanding that
such share was not fully paid up immediately
prior to such reduction, if the by-law reducing
the capita] purports to extinguish the liability
on such share, or beyond the reduced amount
of the liability on such share, if such by-law
purports to reduce the liability on such share.
(2) Where any creditor, entitled in respect
of any debt or claim to object to the reduction
of capital, is, by reason of his ignorance of
the proceedings for reduction, or of their
nature and effect with respect to his claim,
not entered on the list of creditors, and, after
the reduction, the company is unable, within
the meaning of the Winding-up Act to pay the
amount of his debt or claim, then
  * (_a_) every person who was a shareholder of
the company at the date of the supplemen
tary letters patent is liable to contribute for
the payment of that debt or claim an
amount not exceeding the amount that he
would have been liable to contribute if the
company had commenced to be wound up
on the day before the date of the
supplementary letters patent; and,
  * (_b_) if the company is wound up, the court,
on the application of any such creditor and
proof of his ignorance as aforesaid, may, if
it thinks fit, settle accordingly a list of
persons so liable to contribute, and make
and enforce calls and orders on the
contributories settled on the list as if they
were ordinary contributories in a winding-
up.
(3) Nothing in this section affects the rights
the contributories among themselves. R.S.,
c. 53, s. 53.

concealment or misrepresentation, is guilty of
an indictable offence and liable to five years
imprisonment or to a penalty not exceeding
one thousand dollars, or to both. R.S., c. 53,
s. 54.

reduction, the reasons for reduction or such
other information in regard thereto as he may
think expedient with a view to giving proper
information to the public. R.S., c. 53, s. 55.

**58.** An application to the Minister for the
issue of supplementary letters patent to
confirm a by-law for any one or more of the
purposes set forth in sections 51 and 52 may
be made only within six months after the by

1964-65, c. 52, s. 24.

**59.** (1) Before such supplementary letters

to the satisfaction of the Minister the due
passage and sanction of such by-law and the
expediency and bona fide character of the
increase or reduction or other alteration of
capital provided for in the by-law.

oath or affirmation or by statutory declara

purpose of the redemption or purchase ;
but no redemption or purchase for cancellation
shall be made out of the ascertained net
profits of the company when cumulative

expiration of a period, however long, any rule
of equity to the contrary notwithstanding.

determine by express resolution to be in all
the circumstances of the transaction the fair
equivalent of cash to the total nominal
amount of the shares proposed to be issued ;

fully paid of any shares of the capital stock
of the company having a nominal or par
value is liable, jointly and severally with his
co-directors, at the suit of any director,
shareholder or creditor of the company, to
make good to the company the amount by
which the consideration actually received by
the company for any shares so issued and
allotted as aforesaid is found by the court,
after full inquiry into the circumstances of
the transaction, to be less than the fair
equivalent of the cash that the company
ought to have received for such shares if they
had been issued and allotted for cash if the
resolution referred to in subsection 13(15) has
not been passed or if it is proved, as to any
such first-mentioned director, that such direc
tor
  * (_a_) had knowledge that the consideration
so received by the company was not the
fair equivalent of the cash that the company
ought to have received if the shares had
been issued and allotted for cash, or
(6) failed to take reasonable steps to
ascertain whether such consideration so
received by the company was in fact the
fair equivalent as aforesaid.

directors of a public company or any of them
under the authority of subsection (2) by any
creditor, director or shareholder of the

## PROVISIONS OF GENERAL

## APPLICATION

**217.** In this Part
company" means any company incorporated
by or under the authority of any Act of the
Parliament of Canada or of the Legislature
of the former Province of Canada ;
corporation" means a corporation to which
Part II applies. R.S., c. 53, s. 209.

**218.** (1) Every company has, and always
nas na d&amp;gt; the capacity to maintain offices for
the registration and transfer of shares of its
capital stock and of the bonds, debentures,
debenture stock and other securities issued by
the company at any place within or beyond
the limits of Canada.
(2) Unless the books for the registration
anc^ transfer of the shares of the capital stock
and of the bonds, debentures, debenture stock
and other securities of the company are kept
at the chief place of business or head office
of the company in Canada, a book or books
shall be kept at such chief place of business
or head office or at the place in Canada where
one of its branch registration and transfer
offices is maintained, in which shall be
recorded particulars of every registration and
transfer of shares of its capital stock and of
the bonds, debentures, debenture stock and
other securities issued by the company ; but
entry of the transfer of any share, bond,
debenture, debenture stock or other security
in a register of transfers or a branch register
of transfers, whether kept at the chief place
of business or head office of the company or
elsewhere, is, for all purposes, a complete and
valid transfer.
(3) In the case of a company to which Part
I applies, subsection (2) does not apply to the
register of transfers, branch registers of
transfers and books mentioned in section 110.
(4) The court, as defined in subsection 3(1),
of the province in which the head office or
chief place of business of the company is
situated, has jurisdiction, on the application
of any person interested, to order that any
entry in the books for the registration and
transfer of shares of the capital stock of a
company be struck out or otherwise rectified
on the ground that at the date of such
application the entry as it appears in any
such book does not accurately express or
define the existing rights of the person
appearing to be the registered owner of any
snares of the capital stock of the company;
and the court, in deciding such application,
may deem proper.
(5) An application for the rectification of
any such entry under subsection (4) may be
made either by filing with the proper officer
of the court a petition or an originating
summons or notice of motion ; and the court
may direct the trial of any issue arising out
of such application.
(6) Subsections (4) and (5) do not deprive
the court of any jurisdiction it may otherwise
have. R.S., c. 53, s. 210.

applies are : directors of a company or
corporation; managers of a company or
corporation ; officers of a company or corpo

corporation as auditors, whether they are or
are not of the company or corporation.
(2) Where in any proceeding for breach of
or non-compliance with this Act or breach of
or non-compliance with the letters patent,
supplementary letters patent, Special Act, or
by-laws of a company or corporation, against
a person to whom this section applies, it
appears to the court hearing the case that
that person is or may be liable in respect of
such breach or non-compliance, but that he
has acted honestly and reasonably, and that,
having regard to all the circumstances of the
case, including those connected with his
appointment, he ought fairly to be excused
for such breach or non-compliance, that court
may relieve him, either wholly or partly, from
his liability on such terms as the court may
think fit.
(3) Where any person to whom this section
applies has reason to apprehend that any
claim will or might be made against him in
respect of any such breach or non-compliance,
he may apply to the court, as defined in
subsection 3(1), of the province in which the
head office or the principal place of business
of the company or corporation is situated, for
relief, and the court on such application has
the same power to relieve him as under this
section it would have had if it had been a
court before which proceedings against that
for such breach or non-compliance had
brought.
(4) Where any case to which subsection (2)
applies is being tried by a judge with a jury,
the judge, after hearing the evidence, may, if
he is satisfied that the defendant ought in
pursuance of that subsection to be relieved
either in whole or in part from the liability
sought to be enforced against him, withdraw
the case in whole or in part from the jury and
forthwith direct judgment to be entered for
the defendant on such terms as to costs or
otherwise as the judge may think proper.
