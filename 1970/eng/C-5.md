as provided in this Part without regard to the
provisions of this section.
(2) Where any benefit has become payable
commencing with a month in any year, the
basic monthly amount of such benefit shall
be adjusted annually, in prescribed manner,
that the amount payable for a month in

respect to that following year,
by
(6) the ratio that the Pension Index for
that following year bears to the Pension
Index for the year preceding that following
year. 1964-65, c. 51, s. 45.
Retirement Pension

**46.** A retirement pension payable to a
contributor is a basic monthly amount equal
to 25% of his average monthly pensionable
earnings. 1964-65, c. 51, s. 46.

**47.** Where a retirement pension becomes
payable to a contributor commencing with

monthly pensionable earnings are an amount
calculated by dividing his total pensionable
earnings by the basic number of contributory
months. 1964-65, c. 51, s. 47.

**48.** (1) Subject to subsections (2) and (3),

by the total number of months in his
contributory period or by the basic number of
contributory months, whichever is the greater.
(2) Where a contributor has made a contri
bution for earnings after he reached 65 years
of age and the total number of months in his
contributory period exceeds the basic number
of contributory months, in calculating his
average monthly pensionable earnings in

deducted
  * (_a_) from the total number of months in his
contributory period, the number of months
therein after he reached 65 years of age or
by which the total exceeds the basic number
of contributory months, whichever is the
lesser; and
  * (_b_) from his total pensionable earnings, the
aggregate of his pensionable earnings for a
number of months equal to the number of
months deducted under paragraph (a), for
which months such aggregate is less than
the aggregate of his pensionable earnings
for any other like number of months in his
contributory period.
(3) Where the number of months remaining
after making any deduction under subsection
(2) from the total number of months in the
contributory period of a contributor exceeds
120, in calculating his average monthly
pensionable earnings in accordance with
subsection (1) there shall be deducted
  * (_a_) from the number of months so remain
ing, a number of months equal to
  * (_i_) 15% of the number so remaining, and

the fraction shall be taken to be a
complete month,
or

number so remaining exceeds 120,
whichever is the lesser ; and
(6) from his total pensionable earnings
remaining after making any deduction
under subsection (2), the aggregate of his
pensionable earnings for a number of
months equal to the number of months

has already been made under subsection
(2). 1964-65, c. 51,s.48.

**49.** The contributory period of a contribu

contributory period of his pensionable earn
ings for each month calculated as provided in
section 51. 1964-65, c. 51, s. 50.

**51.** (1) The pensionable earnings of a
contributor for a month shall be calculated
by multiplying the earnings for which the

ratio that the average of the Year s Maximum
Pensionable Earnings for the year in which a
retirement pension becomes payable to him
under this Act or under a provincial pension
plan and for each of the 2 preceding years,
bears to the Year s Maximum Pensionable
Earnings for the year that includes that
month.

year. 1964-65, c. 51, s. 51.

**52.** (1) For the purpose of calculating the
pensionable earnings of a contributor for a
month in any year for which the contributor
has made a contribution, the contribution
shall be deemed to have been made for all
months in the year, and the earnings for
which he shall be deemed to have made a
contribution for each month in the year are
an amount calculated by dividing his unad
justed pensionable earnings for the year by
12, except that
  * (_a_) for a year in which the contributor
reaches 18 years of age or in which a
disability pension ceases to be payable to
him under this Act or under a provincial
pension plan, the contribution shall be
that age or after such pension ceased to be
payable, as the case may be, and
(6) for a year in which the contributor
reaches 70 years of age or dies, or in which
a retirement pension or disability pension
becomes payable to him under this Act or
under a provincial pension plan, the
contribution shall be deemed to have been
made for earnings for the months in the
year before the contributor reached 70 years
of age or died or before such pension became
payable, as the case may be ;
in which case the earnings for which he shall
be deemed to have made a contribution for
each such month shall be an amount calculated
by dividing his unadjusted pensionable earn
ings for that year by the number of such
months.
(2) For the purpose of calculating the
pensionable earnings of a contributor for a
month in any year for which the contributor
made no contribution, the amount of the
earnings for which a contribution shall be
deemed to have been made for any month in
the year shall be deemed to be zero.
(3) For the purposes of this Part,
  * (_a_) a contributor shall be deemed to have
made a contribution for any year for which
his unadjusted pensionable earnings exceed
his basic exemption for the year, and shall
be deemed to have made no contribution
for any year for which his unadjusted
pensionable earnings do not exceed his
basic exemption for the year ; and
(6) a contributor shall be deemed to have
made a contribution for earnings for any
month for which a contribution is deemed
by subsection (1) to have been made by
him. 1964-65, c. 51,s.52.

**53.** The unadjusted pensionable earnings
of a contributor for a year are an amount
equal to

ings for the year in the case of an
individual described in section 10,
if such aggregate exceeds the amount of
his basic exemption for the year ;
(6) the aggregate of
  * (_i_) his earnings on which a contribution
has been made for the year under this
Act, calculated as the aggregate of
(A) his salary and wages on which a
contribution has been made for the
year, and
(B) the amount of any contribution
required to be made by him for the
year in respect of his self-employed
earnings, multiplied by 100 and divided
by 3.6,
  * (_ii_) his earnings on which a contribution
has been made for the year under a
provincial pension plan, calculated as the
aggregate of
(A) such amount as is determined in
prescribed manner to be his salary and
wages on which a contribution has been
made for the year by him under a
provincial pension plan, and
(B) the amount of any contribution
required to be made by him for the
year under a provincial pension plan
in respect of his self-employed earnings,

obligation of or guaranteed by the govern
ment of a province, only after notice in
writing to the provincial treasurer or other
similar officer of that province given not
less than 6 months before the date of such
redemption ;
  * (_d_) it is redeemable in whole or in part
before maturity only after all securities of
the same jurisdiction that were issued before
the month in which such obligation was
issued have been fully redeemed, and on
the basis that the amount that shall be
realized at any time by way of redemption
in whole or in part of securities of that
jurisdiction held to the credit of the Canada
Pension Plan Investment Fund is that
proportion of the total amount to be
realized at that time by way of redemption
of securities so held, that
  * (_i_) the aggregate amount then outstand
ing of the securities of that jurisdiction
held to the credit of the Canada Pension
Plan Investment Fund,
is of
  * (_ii_) the aggregate amount then outstand
ing of all securities held to the credit of
the said Fund ;
  * (_e_) the obligation bears interest payable
semi-annually at the rate applicable pur
suant to subsection (2) at the time of the
issue of the obligation ; and

graphs (a) to (e) as may be set forth in, any
agreement in that behalf entered into
between the Minister of Finance and the

tion is issued.
(2) The Minister of Finance may from time
time fix the rate of interest applicable in
case of any obligation described in
(1), which rate shall be calculated
  * (_a_) in the case of an obligation having a
term to maturity of 20 years, on the basis
of the average yield to maturity as
determined by the Minister of Finance of
all outstanding obligations of the Govern
ment of Canada that are not limited or
restricted as to the negotiability or the
transfer or assignment thereof and that
have terms to maturity of 20 years or more,
weighted according to the amounts of those
obligations then outstanding, and
(6) in the case of an obligation having a
term to maturity of less than 20 years, on
the basis of the average yield to maturity
as determined by the Minister of Finance
of all outstanding obligations of the
Government of Canada that are not limited
or restricted as to the negotiability or the
transfer or assignment thereof and that
have terms to maturity within a range
comparable in average duration to the term
of the obligation in respect of which the
calculation is made, weighted according to
the amounts of those obligations then
outstanding ;
except that if the rate of interest so calculated
is not a multiple of 1/100%, it shall be taken
to be the nearest multiple of 1/100% or, if
there is no such nearest multiple, then the
next multiple thereof above that rate.
(3) The Minister of Finance, whenever any
rate of interest is fixed by him pursuant to
subsection (2), shall cause notice of the rate
so fixed to be published forthwith in the
Canada Gazette. 1964-65, c. 51, s. 113.

accruing as described in that subparagraph,
for the assumption of which under the
provincial pension plan of that province
provision has been made by any law of that
province, shall, from and after the day on
which such regulation became effective,
cease to be obligations or liabilities accrued
or accruing with respect to the payment of
benefits under this Act attributable to
contributions made under this Act in respect
of employment in that province or in
respect of self-employed earnings of persons
resident in that province ; and
(6) the Minister of Finance shall pay an
amount calculated as provided in subsection

the transfer to such government in the first
instance and to the extent necessary for
such purpose, of securities of that province
held to the credit of the Canada Pension
Plan Investment Fund, and in the second
instance and to the extent necessary for
such purpose, of securities of Canada held
to the credit of the said Fund, and by the
payment to such government of any balance
then remaining in such manner as may be
prescribed.
(2) For the purposes of subsection (1) the
amount to be calculated as provided in this
subsection in the case of any province shall
be calculated by the Minister of Finance as
the amount obtained by adding

credited to the Canada Pension Plan
Account, to the day on which the regulation
referred to in subsection (1) became effective,
in respect of employment in that province
or in respect of self-employed earnings of
persons resident in that province, and

accrued to the credit of the Canada Pension
Plan Account, to the day on which the
regulation referred to in subsection (1)
became effective, as derived from the
contributions referred to in paragraph (a),
and subtracting from the total so obtained
  * (_c_) such part of all amounts paid as or on
account of benefits under this Act as would
not have been payable under this Act if
that province had been a province described
in subparagraph 3(l)(a)(i), and
  * (_d_) such part of the costs of administration
of this Act, to the day on which the
regulation referred to in subsection (1)
became effective, as is equal to the
proportion of such costs that the total
amount of the contributions referred to in
paragraph (a) is of the total amount of all
contributions credited to the Canada Pen
sion Plan Account to that day.
(3) Where notice in writing has been given
to tne Minister by the government of a
province as described in subsection 3(1), the
Minister, with the approval of the Governor

under prescribed conditions of any infor
mation obtained under this Act, including
records of any amounts that are shown in
the Record of Earnings to the accounts of
persons who have made contributions under
this Act in respect of employment in that
province or as persons resident in that
province in respect of self-employed earn
ings; and

arrangements as may be necessary to permit
provision to be made for the assumption,
under the provincial pension plan referred
to in the notice, of all obligations and
liabilities accrued or accruing as described
