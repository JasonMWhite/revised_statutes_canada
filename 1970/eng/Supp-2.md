CHAPTER 2 (IstSupp.)
An Act to prevent pollution of areas of
the arctic waters adjacent to the
mainland and islands of the Canadian
arctic
[1969-70, c. 47]
WHEREAS Parliament recognizes that
recent developments in relation to the ex
ploitation of the natural resources of
arctic areas, including the natural resources

time recognizes and is determined to fulfil
its obligation to see that the natural re
sources of the Canadian arctic are de
veloped and exploited and the arctic waters
adjacent to the mainland and islands of
the Canadian arctic are navigated only in
a manner that takes cognizance of Can
ada s responsibility for the welfare of the
Eskimo and other inhabitants of the Cana
dian arctic and the preservation of the pe
culiar ecological balance that now exists
in the water, ice and land areas of the
Canadian arctic;
Now therefore, Her Majesty, by and

follows:
