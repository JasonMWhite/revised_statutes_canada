invoice so that there can be no doubt as to its
being the invoice to which the oath is intended
to apply, and such oath shall be subscribed

oath required by this Act ; and such oath is
sufficient unless the goods have not been
obtained by purchase in the ordinary way,

concerned in the manufacture or production
thereof, in which case the oath of such non
the facts shall be requisite to the due
attestation of the invoice. R.S., c. 58, s. 28.

and verify the invoice, if the owner or one of
the owners is not the person entering the
goods; and shall also, if required by the
collector, be attested by the oath of the non
resident owner being the manufacturer or
producer of the goods, in the case mentioned
in section 28, although one of the owners is
the person entering the goods and verifying
the invoice on oath. R.S., c. 58, s. 29.

of any goods is dead, or a bankrupt or
insolvent, or where for any cause his personal

person, his executor, curator, administrator or
assignee, or person administering as aforesaid,
may, if cognizant of the facts, take any oath
and make any entry that the owner, importer
or consignee might otherwise have taken or
made. R.S., c. 58, s. 30.

**31.** No person other than the owner,
consignee or importer of the goods of which
entry is to be made, shall be allowed to take
any oath connected with the entry, unless

referred to, a declaration by the owner,
consignee or importer of the goods, or his
attorney and agent duly appointed to transact
business with the collector, pursuant to the
provisions in that behalf of this Act, to the
same effect as the oath, distinctly referring to

and signed by the owner, importer or
consignee, or by his attorney and agent
appointed as aforesaid, either in the presence
of the agent making the entry, or of a justice

## VALUATION FOR DUTY

**35.** (1) The value for duty of goods
imported shall be determined in accordance
with the provisions of sections 36 to 44.
(2) In this section and sections 36 to 44,
with reference to any goods,
"cost of production" means an amount that
in accordance with good business principles
and practices fairly reflects the manufac
turing or production costs of the goods at
the time of shipment to Canada ;
"country of export" means the country from
which the goods were shipped directly to
Canada;
"duty" does not include duty or provisional
duty imposed under the Anti-dumping Act;
"gross profit" means the fair market value of
the goods when sold in the circumstances
described in section 36, minus the cost of
production thereof. 1953-54, c. 3, s. 1 ; 1955,
c. 32, s. 2; 1958, c. 26, s. 1; 1965, c. 16, s. 2;
1968-69, c. 10, s. 36.

**36.** (1) Subject to section 39, the value for
duty shall, notwithstanding any invoice or
affidavit to the contrary, be the fair market
value, at the time when and place from which
the goods were shipped directly to Canada,
of like goods when sold
  * (_a_) to purchasers located at that place with
whom the vendor deals at arm s length and
who are at the same or substantially the
same trade level as the importer, and
(6) in the same or substantially the same
quantities for home consumption in the
ordinary course of trade under competitive
conditions.
(2) The following rules apply in the
application of subsection (1):
  * (_a_) if there were no sales at the time when
the goods were shipped to Canada, there
shall be substituted therefor the most recent
sales prior to the time of shipment that
fairly reflect the market value of the goods
at the time of shipment ;
(6) if there were no purchasers located at
the place from which the goods were shipped
to Canada, there shall be substituted
therefor sales to the purchasers located
nearest thereto;
  * (_c_) where goods imported into Canada and
goods sold for home consumption are like
goods except only that the goods sold for
home consumption have applied to them a
trade mark, as defined in the Trade Marks
Act, that is not applied to the goods
imported into Canada, and goods like the
goods imported are not sold for home
consumption, the goods imported and the
goods sold for home consumption shall be
deemed to be like goods for the purposes of
this section, if, in the opinion of the
Minister,
  * (_i_) the goods are being imported into
Canada without that trade mark applied
to them in order to avoid the operation
of subsection (1), and
  * (_ii_) it is probable that there will be
applied to the goods, subsequent to their
importation into Canada, that trade mark
or any other mark so closely resembling
that trade mark that it is likely to be
taken therefor ;
  * (_d_) regard shall not be had to a sale for
home consumption to a purchaser by a
vendor who did not, at the same or
substantially the same time, sell like goods
in the ordinary course of trade to other
persons in the country of export, not
controlled by or in control of or otherwise
related to the purchaser; and
  * (_e_) where goods were not sold in the same
or substantially the same quantities for
home consumption
  * (_i_) if the quantity shipped to Canada is
larger than the largest quantity sold for
home consumption, those quantities shall
be deemed to be the same quantities,
  * (_ii_) if the quantity shipped to Canada is
smaller than the smallest quantity sold
for home consumption, the value for duty
shall be based on the amount for which,
in the opinion of the Minister, having
regard to that trade, such smaller quanti
ties would have been sold if they had
been sold for home consumption.
(3) Where the value for duty cannot be
determined under subsections (1) and (2) for
the reason that
  * (_a_) there were no purchasers in the country
of export (in this subsection called "home
purchasers") who were at the same or
substantially the same trade level as the
importer, or
  * (_b_) although there were home purchasers
who were at the same or substantially the
same trade level as the importer, there were
no sales to them in the circumstances
described in subsections (1) and (2),
the home purchasers, if any, at the trade level
nearest and subsequent to that of the importer
to whom sales were made in the circumstances
described in subsections (1) and (2) shall, for
the purposes of those subsections, be deemed
to have been at the same trade level as the
importer. 1958, c. 26, s. 1.

**37.** Subject to section 39, where like goods
were not sold for home consumption, or were
not sold for home consumption in the
circumstances described in section 36, but
similar goods were so sold, the value for duty
notwithstanding any invoice or affidavit
to the contrary, be the aggregate of
goods is of the cost of production of the
similar goods. 1958, c. 26, s. 1.

**38.** Where the Governor in Council is
satisfied, on a report from the Minister, that
the application of subparagraph 36(2)(e)(i) or
subsection 36(3) is inequitable in that it results
in discrimination against the importation of
goods of a class from any country, as compared
with the importation of goods of that class
from any other country, the Governor in
Council may prescribe the manner in which
the value for duty of goods of that class, as
determined under section 36 or 37, shall be
reduced; but the value for duty of any
imported goods upon being reduced as
provided in this section shall not be less than
an amount equal to the cost of production of
the goods plus such amount for gross profit
as is deemed reasonable by the Governor in
Council. 1965, c. 16, s. 3.

**39.** Where in any case or class of cases
  * (_a_) the value for duty cannot be determined
under section 36 or 37 for the reason that
like or similar goods are not sold in the
country of export or are not sold in such
country in the circumstances described in
those sections,
(6) the goods imported
  * (_i_) are intended to be assembled, pack
aged or further manufactured in Canada
or are intended to enter into the course
of manufacture in Canada,
  * (_ii_) are used or obsolete goods,
  * (_iii_) are not prime quality goods as known
in the trade, or are known in the trade as
remnants, close-outs or discontinued lines
or are surplus goods,
  * (_iv_) constitute a job lot, or
  * (_v_) are intended to be used directly in
the process of manufacture or production
of goods and like goods are not sold in
the country of export,
  * (_c_) like goods are leased but not sold in the
country of export, or
  * (_d_) the Minister is of opinion that by reason
of unusual circumstances the application of
sections 36 and 37 is impracticable,
the value for duty shall be determined in
such manner as the Minister prescribes. 1958,
c. 26, s. 1.
4Q. Where sufficient information has not
been furnished or is not available to enable
the determination of cost of production, gross
profit or fair market value under section 36
or 37, the cost of production, gross profit or
fair market value, as the case may be, shall
be determined in such manner as the Minister
prescribes. 1958, c. 26, s. 1.

**41.** (\) Notwithstanding anything in this
Act, where the value for duty as determined
under sections 36 to 40 is less than the amount
for which the goods were sold to the purchaser
in Canada, exclusive of all charges thereon
after their shipment from the country of
export, the value for duty shall be the amount
for which the goods were sold, less the amount,
if any, by which the fair market value of the
goods has decreased between the time of
purchase and the time of exportation.
(2) The amount of any internal tax imposed
within the country of export or origin on any
goods imported into Canada, from which such
goods have been exempted or have been or
will be relieved by means of a refund or
drawback, shall be deducted from the value
for duty of such goods as determined under
sections 36 to 40.
(3) The Governor in Council may order
that such import duties imposed within the
country of export or origin as he specifies
shall be deducted, in whole or in part, from
the value for duty of any goods as determined
under sections 36 to 40.
(4) In determining the value for duty of
any goods, no discount or deduction shall be
goods of the same material, or of a similar
kind but a different quality, that are shipped
in the same package, and were invoiced or
sold at an average price, the value for duty
of the best article contained in such package
shall be deemed to be the average value of
all the goods.
(6) For the purposes of sections 36 to 40,
where goods are shipped to Canada on
consignment,
  * (_a_) if the goods were sold in the course of
transit before importation, the person to
whom such goods are sold shall be deemed
to be the importer, and
  * (_b_) in all other cases, the consignee shall be
deemed to be the importer. 1958, c. 26, s. 1 ;
1968-69, c. 10, s. 36.

**42.** (1) If the value for duty as determined
under sections 36 to 41, does not include
  * (_a_) the amount of any subsidy or drawback
of customs duty that has been allowed by
the government of any other country, or
  * (_b_) the amount or money value of any so-
called royalty, rent or charge for use of any
machine or goods of any description, that
the seller or proprietor does or would
usually charge thereon when the same are
sold or leased or rented for use in the
country of export,
such amount shall be added thereto.
(2) There shall be added to the value for
duty as determined under sections 36 to 41
the amount of consideration or money value
of any special arrangement between the
exporter and the importer, or between any
persons interested therein, because of the
exportation or intended exportation of such
goods, or the right to territorial limits for the
sale or use thereof. 1958, c. 26, s. 1.

**43.** Goods bona fide exported to Canada
from &amp;lt; an y country but passing ... in transit
through another shall, upon such terms and
conditions as to shipment, documentation,
warehousing, transhipment or the like as the
Governor in Council may prescribe, be valued
for duty as if they were imported direct from
such first mentioned country. R.S., c. 58, s.

**44.** In the case of any imported goods that
  * (_a_) were shipped indirectly to Canada from
the country of origin through one or more
other countries; and
  * (_b_) would, but for this section, be valued
for duty under sections 36 to 42 at less than
the value for duty of such goods would be
if the country of export were the country of
origin,
the goods shall, notwithstanding subsection
36(1), upon such terms and conditions as to
shipment, documentation, warehousing, tran
shipment or the like as the Governor in
Council may prescribe, be valued for duty as
if they were imported direct from the country
of origin at the time they were first shipped
from that country. 1965, c. 16, s. 4.

  * (_a_) prescribe the methods to be followed in
determining the classification of sugar,
molasses and syrup for the purposes of the

and appliances to be used in such determi
nation; and
  * (_c_) provide that such determination and
classification shall be carried out by desig

, , ?
inquiry as he deems necessary, confirm or

s. 42.

nation of the tariff classification or an
appraisal of the value for duty of any goods,

conclusive unless the importer, within ninety
of the date of entry, makes a written
request in prescribed form and manner to a
Dominion customs appraiser for a re-determi
nation or a re-appraisal.

to this Act or any regulation shall exhibit, in
the currency of the country of export, the fair
market value of the goods to which it relates,
determined in accordance with sections 36 to
42, and the true price at which such goods
were sold by the vendor to the purchaser ; and
in computing the value for duty of the goods
in Canadian currency the rate of exchange
shall be such as may be declared from time to
time by the Bank of Canada.
(2) Where the rate of exchange of the
currency of any country has not been so
declared, or where multiple rates of exchange
exist, a conversion rate which shall reflect
effectively the current value of such currency
in commercial transactions may be determined
and ordered by the Minister.
(3) All such invoices shall faithfully exhibit
the transaction between the exporter and the
importer, and contain a true and full statement
of the actual price payable for the goods,
including cartons, cases and coverings of all
kinds and all expenses incident to placing the
goods in condition, packed ready for shipment
to Canada, and no such invoice shall state
any discount other than such as has been
actually allowed to the importer. R.S., c. 58,
s. 47; 1955, c. 32, s. 5; 1958, c. 26, s. 4.

**52.** Whenever duties are imposed according
to any specific quantity or to any specific
value, such duties shall be deemed to apply
the same proportion to any greater or less
or value, and to any fractional part
such specific quantity. R.S., c. 58, s. 48.

**53.** Whenever duties are charged according
to the weight, tale, gauge or measure, such
allowances shall be made for tare and draft
upon the packages as are prescribed by
regulations made by the Governor in Council.
R.S..C. 58,s.49.

**54.** If an article is enumerated in the tariff
under two or more names or descriptions, and
there is a difference of duty, the highest duty
provided shall be charged and collected
thereon. R.S., c. 58, s. 50.

**55.** (i) i n the case of all wines, spirits, or
alcoholic liquors subject to duty according to
their relative strength of proof, such strength
shall be ascertained either by means of Sykes
hydrometer or of the specific gravity bottle,
as the Minister directs.
(2) If such relative strength cannot be
correctly ascertained by the direct use of the
hydrometer or gravity bottle it shall be
ascertained by the distillation of a sample
and the subsequent test in like manner of the
distillate. R.S., c. 58, s. 51.

**56.** Goods derelict, flotsam, jetsam or
wreck, or landed or saved from any vessel
wrecked, stranded or lost, brought or coming
into Canada, are subject to the same duties
and regulations as goods of the like kind
imported are subject to. R.S., c. 58, s. 52.

**57.** The collector or any appraiser may
take samples of any goods imported, for the
purpose of ascertaining whether any and what
duties are payable on such goods; and such
samples shall be disposed of as the Minister
directs. R.S., c. 58, s. 53.

**58.** (1) The equipments or any part thereof,
including boats purchased or supplied in a

intended to be employed, or which is thereafter
employed, in the coasting trade of Canada,
and the payment of duty on the cost
in the foreign country
  * (_a_) on the expenses of repairs, twenty-five
per cent ad valorem; and
  * (_b_) on equipments, including boats, the
same rate of duty as if the articles were
imported into Canada in the ordinary
course.
(2) If the owner or master of the vessel
wilfully and knowingly neglects or fails to
report, make entry and pay duties as required
by this section, the vessel, with her tackle,
apparel and furniture, shall be seized and
forfeited.
(3) if j however, the owner or master of the
vessel furnishes satisfactory evidence that the
vessel, while in the regular course of her
voyage, was compelled by stress of weather or
casualty to put into a foreign port to make
the said repairs, in order to secure the safety
of the vessel or to enable her to reach her port
of destination, or that it would be impracti
cable to make the repairs in Canada for the
want of a dock of sufficient capacity to receive
the vessel, the Minister may authorize the
refund of the duties on the repairs, and the
vessel is not liable to forfeiture under
subsection (2). R.S., c. 58, s. 54.

**59.** The surplus stores of vessels arriving
in Canada shall be subject to the same duties
and regulations as if imported as merchandise ;
but if the owner or master desires to warehouse
such stores for reshipment for the future use
of the vessel, the collector may permit him to
do so. R.S., c. 58, s. 55.

## GOODS DAMAGED OR LOST

**60.** If any goods imported by water, or
partly by water and partly by land, on which
duties, ad valorem or specific, or both, are
payable, receive damage during the voyage
of importation, between the actual departure
of the vessel in which they are laden from the
foreign port of exportation and the actual
arrival of the goods at the port of destination
in Canada, whereby such goods have become
in value, an abatement may be made,
the manner hereinafter provided, in the
duty payable upon such goods, or if duty has
paid thereon, a refund of a part of such
may be made proportionate to the
damage sustained, if, in either case, the claim
therefor is made in due form and is properly
substantiated at the first landing from such
vessel of the said goods, and while they are
in the custody of the Crown, or as soon after
such first landing as they can be examined

by any other vehicle, on which duties, ad
valorem or specific, or both, are payable,
receive damage during the course of transpor
tation, after they are laden on such railway
or other vehicle, and before they arrive at the
port of destination in Canada, whereby they
become lessened in value, an abatement may
be made in the manner hereinafter provided
in the duty payable upon such goods, if the
claim for such abatement is made in due form
within thirty days of the date of entry or of
the arrival of such goods at the port of
destination in Canada, and is substantiated
in the same manner as is provided in section
60 ; but in estimating the damage by breakage

percentage of saccharine matter shown by the
damaged, as established by a certificate from
the customs experts employed by him to make
such test. R.S., c. 58, s. 60.

**65.** When the collector or appraiser has
ascertained the percentage of damage, such
percentage shall be deducted from the original
value of the goods, and duty shall then be
levied and collected on such reduced value at
an ad valorem rate, which shall be equivalent
to the rate of specific or specific and ad
valorem duty that should have been collected
upon such goods if they had not been so
damaged. R.S., c. 58, s. 61.

to another port of entry in Canada, or while
within the limits of any port of entry and

of the officers, the duties on the whole or the
part thereof so proved to have been injured
or destroyed may be abated or refunded, if
the claim is made within thirty days after the
date of the casualty, and due appraisement is
made of the goods so alleged to be injured as
soon as they can be examined. 1962, c. 27, s.

imported into Canada; but in assessing the
same, under this Act, such allowance or
damage shall only be made and allowed for

the Minister in the proportion and on
fulfilment of the conditions hereinbefore
specified, but not otherwise. R.S., c. 58, s. 63.

purpose shall give security by bond of
an incorporated guarantee company author
ized to do business in Canada, and whose
bonds are acceptable to the Government of
Canada, such bond to be in form approved
by the Minister, in double the duties of

aforesaid is for exportation by land or inland
navigation, shall be landed and delivered at
the place for which they are entered outwards,

landed and left at some place, naming it, out
of Canada, as provided for in the entry, or, if
it is proved to the satisfaction of the collector
or other proper officer that the goods were,
after leaving Canada, lost and destroyed, the
person making such export entry shall be
deemed to have satisfied the obligation
thereby imposed upon him and if security by
bond has been given, the bond may be
cancelled. R.S., c. 58, s. 86.
9 j. Th e Minister may define and limit the
kind, quantity and class of goods that may

the goods in case of any untrue report, as if
the report were made by the master; and the
word "master", when elsewhere used in this
Act in relation to such reports, shall, for the
purposes of this section, be construed as
including the purser of any steam vessel.
(2) Nothing in this section precludes the
collector or other proper officer from calling
upon the master of any steam vessel to answer
all such questions concerning the vessel,
passengers, cargo and crew, as might be
lawfully demanded of him if the report had
been made by him, or to exempt the master
or the vessel from the penalties imposed by
this Act for failure to answer any such
question, or for answering untruly, or to
prevent the master from making such report,
if he sees fit so to do. R.S., c. 58, s. 91.
VERIFICATION OF ENTRIES

**95.** (1) No entry and no warrant for the
landing of any goods, or for the taking of any
goods out of any warehouse shall be deemed
valid unless the particulars of the goods and
packages in such entry or warrant correspond
with the particulars of the goods and packages
purporting to be the same in the report of the
vessel or other report, where any is required,
by which the importation or entry thereof is
authorized, nor unless the goods have been
properly described in such entry by the
denominations and with the characters and
circumstances, according to which such goods
are charged with duty or may be imported.
(2) Any goods taken or delivered out of
any vessel, or out of any warehouse, or
conveyed into Canada beyond the port or
place of entry, by virtue of any entry or
not corresponding with the facts in
all such respects, or not properly describing
the goods, shall be deemed to be goods landed
or taken without due entry thereof, and may
be dealt with accordingly. R.S., c. 58, s. 92.

**97.** The collector or other proper officer
may cause any package of goods described in
a bill of entry to be opened and the contents
thereof to be examined for the purpose of
making an appraisal or in order to verify the
information given in such entry. 1968-69, c.
18,s.4.

**98.** Any package of which the importer or
his agent declares the contents to be unknown
to him may be opened and examined by the
collector or other proper officer in the presence
of such importer or agent, and at the expense
of the importer, who shall also bear the
expense of repacking. R.S., c. 58, s. 94.

**99.** Before admitting to entry any goods
charged with duty, or exempt or conditionally
exempt from duty, the collector may require
from the importer of the goods or from his
agent such further proof as he deems necessary,
by oath or declaration, production of invoices
or bills of lading, or otherwise, that such
goods are properly described and rated for
duty, or come properly within the meaning
of such exemptions. R.S., c. 58, s. 98.

**100.** (1) The collector shall require that
the true invoice from the exporter to the
owner of the goods be delivered for duty
purposes with the bill of entry at the custom
house, when such goods have been sold by the
exporter thereof prior to their arrival in
Canada, although the goods arrive in Canada
consigned to a person other than their owner.

on consignment, when such goods have not
been sold by the exporter thereof prior to
their arrival in Canada, the owner or his
agent or consignee shall deliver to the collector

terms and conditions on which the goods are
to be sold, accounted for, or disposed of, in
  * (_a_) the importation of any goods, if made
by sea, coastwise or by inland navigation,
in any vessel, shall be deemed to have been
completed from the time such goods were
brought within the limits of Canada,

tional, within three miles of the coasts or
shores of Canada, and if made by land,
then from the time such goods were brought
within the limits of Canada ;
  * (_b_) the exportation of any goods from
Canada shall be deemed to have been
commenced from the time of the legal
shipment of such goods for exportation

any undecked vessel, from the time the
goods were carried beyond the limits of
Canada ;
  * (_c_) the date of exportation in any decked
vessel of any goods to Canada, from any
port or place out of Canada, shall be
deemed and taken to be the date at which
such goods actually left such port or place
out of Canada for their destination in
Canada, which date may be established by
the production of the clearance of the vessel
from such port or place out of Canada, or
the oath of the master as to the date of
sailing, if such sailing was subsequent to
the date of the clearance ;
  * (_d_) the time of the arrival of any vessel in
a Canadian port shall be deemed to be the
time at which the report of such vessel was,
is, or ought to have been made ; and

from a Canadian port shall be deemed to
be the time of the last clearance of such
vessel on the voyage on which it departed.
R.S.,c. 58,8. 100.

## DUTIES CONSTITUTE A DEBT

constitutes a debt due and payable to
Majesty, jointly and severally, from the
of the goods at the time of the
importation or exportation thereof, and from
the importer or exporter thereof, as the case
may be; and such debt may, at any time, be
recovered with full costs of suit, in any court
of competent jurisdiction, and any goods
afterwards imported or exported by the owner

special entry in a form and manner
prescribed by the Minister, free of duty or

intended for the use to which they were so
diverted. 1968-69, c. 18, s. 7.

person to whom the refund, drawback or
remission may be granted, in lieu thereof, a
refund, drawback or remission in an amount
determined, in such manner as the Governor

(7) No person on board any vessel required
to proceed to come to a stop, as herein
provided, shall throw overboard, stave, or

other person that the vessel was within
Canadian waters or Canadian customs waters
is prima facie proof of the fact.

customs waters, and examine the manifest
and inspect, search and examine the vessel
and every part thereof, and any person, trunk,
package or cargo on board.

within the meaning of subsection (2) may be
seized and forfeited, together with all stores
and cargo that were upon such vessel at the
time of the hovering, but the following goods
shall be released, without liability resulting
directly or indirectly from such seizure or
forfeiture, upon the furnishing of proof
satisfactory to the Minister that they are
  * (_a_) goods, respecting which there has not
been any violation of any of the provisions
of this Act, that are in the hands of a person
in Canada who acquired the goods for value
and in good faith ;
(6) effects of an innocent passenger ; or
  * (_c_) goods respecting which there has not
been any violation of any of the provisions
of this Act and in respect to which neither

knowledge or grounds for suspicion that the
goods were destined to be smuggled into
Canada or into any other country.
(11) The master or person in command and
crew of any vessel that is a hovering vessel
within the meaning of subsection (2) and all
other persons on board at the time of the
hovering and all owners or persons beneficially
interested in the vessel or cargo shall be
deemed to have violated a provision of this
Act unless they prove that they had no
knowledge or grounds for suspicion that the
goods on board were destined to be smuggled
into Canada or any other country.
(12) The powers conferred by subsection (3)
on an officer, may be exercised, and subsec
tions (4) to (11) are applicable to a hovering
vessel, either at the place where the vessel is

arises out of or is connected with the
administration of this Act.

the powers of a customs officer who on
reasonable and probable grounds believes that
an offence, declared by this Act to be an
indictable offence, or declared by the Criminal
Code to be an indictable offence whenever
such offence arises out of or is connected with
administration of this Act, has been
committed, whether it has been committed or
not, and who on reasonable and probable
grounds believes that any person has commit-
ted that offence is justified in arresting such
person without warrant. R.S., c. 58, s. 140.

ized thereunto, may search any person on
board any vessel or boat within any port in

condemnation of the thing seized, if proceed
ings for condemnation are taken in court ; or
shall become the property of Her Majesty, if
the thing seized becomes condemned without
proceedings in court ; but the collector shall

**256.** Any judge of the court in which any

costs, in case judgment is given against
him. R.S., c. 58, s. 256.

**257.** In any declaration, information,

prosecution or suit, it is sufficient to state the
penalty or forfeiture incurred, and the Act
and section of the Act, or the rule orregulation
under which it is alleged to have been
incurred, without further particulars; and the
averment that the person seizing or suing was
and is an officer, is sufficient prima facie

ad satisfaciendum against the person of the
defendant under the same conditions and in
like manner. R.S., c. 58, s. 258.

**259.** If, in any case, the Attorney General

terms as he sees fit, which is binding on all
for the recovery of any penalty or
in respect of any forfeiture as aforesaid, or
for an offence against this Act or any other
law relating to the customs, or to trade or
navigation, the averment that the cause of
prosecution or suit arose, or that such offence
was committed within the limits of any
district, county, port or place, is sufficient
evidence of the fact without proof of such
limits, unless the contrary is proved. R.S., c.
58, s. 260.

**261.** If, in any information, action, prose
cution or other proceeding respecting any

sureties to the satisfaction of such magistrate,
judge, justice or justices of the peace, to abide
the event of such appeal.
(2) An appeal also lies from the Exchequer
Court of Canada, the superior courts and
count} courts respectively, in cases where the
amount of the penalty of forfeiture is such

under this Act, or any law relating to the
customs, trade or navigation, the execution of

thing to the claimant thereof, shall not be
suspended by reason of any appeal from such

sufficient security, approved by the court or
a judge thereof, to render and deliver the
thing in question or the full value thereof to
the appellant, in case the decision or judgment
so appealed from is reversed. R.S., c. 58, s.

## SCHEDULE

## NORTH ATLANTIC FISHERIES AWARD
From Answer of Tribunal of Arbitration Con
stituted in Accordance with the Provisions of Article
T" of the Special Agreement between His Majesty
and the United States of America, Signed at Wash
ington the 27th January, 1909.

## THE HAGUE, SEPTEMBER 7, 1910

## THE NORTH ATLANTIC COAST FISHERIES
QUESTION V
From where must be measured the "three marine miles of any
of the coasts, bays, creeks, or harbours" referred to in the said
article?
For these reasons the tribunal decides and awards :
In case of bays, the three marine miles are to be measured
from a straight line drawn across the body of water at the place
where it ceases to have the configuration and characteristics of
a bay. At all other places the three marine miles are to be
measured following the sinuosities of the coast.
But considering the Tribunal cannot overlook that this an
swer to Question V, although correct in principle, and the only
one possible in view of the want of a sufficient basis for a more
concrete answer is not entirely satisfactory as to its practical
applicability, and that it leaves room for doubts and differences
in practice ; therefore the Tribunal considers it its duty to
render the decision more practicable, and to remove the danger
of future differences by adjoining to it a recommendation in
virtue of the responsibilities imposed by Article IV of the
Special Agreement.
Considering, moreover, that in treaties with France, with the
North German Confederation and the German Empire, and
likewise in the North Sea Convention, Great Britain has
adopted for similar cases the rule that only bays of ten miles
width should be considered as those wherein the fishing is
reserved to nationals: And that in the course of the negotia
tions between Great Britain and the United States a similar
rule has been on various occasions proposed and adopted by
Great Britain in instructions to the naval officers stationed on
these coasts: And that though these circumstances are not
sufficient to constitute this a principle of international law. it
seems reasonable to Dropose this rule with certain exceptions,
all the more that this rale, with such exceptions has already
formed the basis of an agreement between the two Powers.
Now, therefore, this Tribunal, in pursuance of the provisions
of Article IV, hereby recommends for the consideration and
acceptance of the High Contracting Parties the following rules
and methods of procedure for determining the limits of the
bays hereinbefore enumerated :

**1.**
In every bay not hereinafter specifically provided for the
limits of exclusion shall be drawn three miles seaward from a
straight line across the bay in the part nearest the entrance at
the first point where the width does not exceed ten miles.

**2.**
In the following bays, where the configuration of the coast
the local climatic conditions are such that foreign fisher
when within the geographic headlands, might reasonably
and bona fide believe themselves on the high seas, the limits of
exclusion shall be drawn in each case between the headlands
hereinafter specified as being those at and within which such
fishermen might be reasonably expected to recognize the bay
under average conditions.
For the Baie des Chaleurs the line from the light at Birch
Point on Miscou Island to Maquereau Point Light ; for the bay
of Miramichi, the line from the light at Point Escuminac to the
light on the eastern point of Tabusintac Gully; for Egmont
Bay, in Prince Edward Island, the line from the light at Cape
Egmont to the light at West Point; and off St. Ann s Bay, in
the province of Nova Scotia, the line from the light at Point
Anconi to the nearest point on the opposite shore of the
mainland.
For Fortune Bay, in Newfoundland, the line from Connaigre
Head to the light on the southeasterly end of Brunei Island,
thence to Fortune Head.
For or near the following bays the limits of exclusion shall be
three marine miles seaward from the following lines, namely:
For or near Harrington Bay in Nova Scotia, the line from the
light on Stoddart Island to the light on the south point of Cape
Sable, thence to the light at Baccaro Point ; at Chedabucto and
St. Peter s Bays, the line from Cranberry Island light to Green
Island light, thence to Point Rouge; for Mira Bay, the line
from the light on the east point of Scatari Island to the north
easterly point of Cape Morien; and at Placentia Bay, in New
foundland, the line from Latine Point, on the eastern mainland
shore, to the most southerly point of Red Island, thence by the
most southerly point of Marasheen Island to the mainland.
Long Island and Bryer Island on St. Mary s Bay, in Nova
Scotia, shall, for the purpose of delimitation, be taken as the
coasts of such bays.
It is understood that nothing in these rules refers either to
the Bay of Fundy considered as a whole apart from its bays and
creeks or as to the innocent passage through the Gut of Canso,
which were- excluded by the agreement made by exchange of
notes between Mr. Bacon and Mr. Bryce, dated February 21st,
1909, and March 4th, 1909; or to Conception Bay, which was
provided for by the decision of the Privy Council in the case of
the Direct United States Cable Company v. the Anglo-American
Telegraph Company, in which decision the United States have
acquiesced.
