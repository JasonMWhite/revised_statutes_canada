eighteen years of age at the time of the
death of the contributor are living apart
from the widow at the time the payment is
to be made, the total amount shall be paid

was prohibited from marrying by reason of
a previous marriage either of the contributor
or of herself to another person, been
maintained and publicly represented by
that contributor as his wife, or

whom this subsection would apply, but for
her marriage to a contributor after such time

commenced being so represented.
(5) jf ( U p On the death of a contributor, it
appears to the Minister that the widow of the
contributor had, immediately prior to his
death, been living apart from him under
circumstances that would have disentitled her
to an order for separate maintenance under
the laws of the province in which the
contributor was ordinarily resident, and if the
Minister so directs, having regard to the
surrounding circumstances, including the wel
fare of any children involved, she shall be
deemed, for the purposes of this Act, to have

person became or continued to be a contribu

where a contributor dies within one year after

in having an expectation of surviving for at
least one year thereafter.

twenty or more years, be reduced by an
amount determined in accordance with the
regulations.
(5) Subsections (1) and (2) do not apply in
respect of any contributor whose death

prejudice any right that a child of an earlier
marriage of the contributor has to an allowance
under section 12.
(7) j n this Act, unless the context otherwise
requires, "widow" includes "widower", but no
person is entitled to an allowance under this
Act by virtue of being the widower of a
