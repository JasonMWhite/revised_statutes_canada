## INTRODUCTORY ARTICLE
  * (_i_) The International Monetary Fund is established and
shall operate in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement as originally adopted, and as subsequently
amended in order to institute a facility based on special
drawing rights and to effect certain other changes,
  * (_ii_) To enable the Fund to conduct its operations and
transactions, the Fund shall maintain a General Account
and a Special Drawing Account. Membership in the Fund
shall give the right to participation in the Special Drawing
Account.
  * (_iii_) Operations and transactions authorized by this Agree
ment shall be conducted through the General Account
except that operations and transactions involving special
drawing rights shall be conducted through the Special
Drawing Account.
Article I
Purposes
The purposes of the International Monetary Fund are :
  * (_i_) To promote international monetary cooperation through
a permanent institution which provides the machinery for
consultation and collaboration on international monetary
problems.
  * (_ii_) To facilitate the expansion and balanced growth of
international trade, and to contribute thereby to the
promotion and maintenance of high levels of employment
and real income and to the development of the productive
resources of all members as primary objectives of economic
policy.
  * (_iii_) To promote exchange stability, to maintain orderly
exchange arrangements among members, and to avoid
competitive exchange depreciation.
  * (_iv_) To assist in the establishment of a multilateral system
of payments in respect of current transactions between
members and in the elimination of foreign exchange
restrictions which hamper the growth of world trade.
  * (_v_) To give confidence to members by making the Fund s
resources temporarily available to them under adequate
safeguards, thus providing them with opportunity to correct
maladjustments in their balance of payments without
resorting to measures destructive of national or international
prosperity.
  * (_vi_) In accordance with the above, to shorten the duration
and lessen the degree of disequilibrium in the international
balances of payments of members.
Fund shall be guided in all its policies and decisions by
governments accept membership
the date specified in Article XX, Section 2(e).
Section 2. Other members
Membership shall be open to the governments of other
countries at such times and in accordance with such terms as
may be prescribed by the Fund.
Article III
Quotas and Subscriptions
Section 1. Quotas
Each member shall be assigned a quota. The quotas of the
members represented at the United Nations Monetary and
Financial Conference which accept membership before the date
specified in Article XX, Section 2(e), shall be those set forth in
Schedule A. The quotas of other members shall be determined
by the Fund.
Section 2. Adjustment of quotas
The Fund shall at intervals of not more than five years
conduct a general review, and if it deems it appropriate propose
an adjustment, of the quotas of the members. It may also, if it
thinks fit, consider at any other time the adjustment of any
particular quota at the request of the member concerned. An
eighty-five per cent majority of the total voting power shall be
required for any change in quotas proposed as the result of a
general review and a four-fifths majority of the total voting
power shall be required for any other change in quotas. No
quota shall be changed without the consent of the member
concerned.
Section 3. Subscriptions: time, place, and form of payment
  * (_a_) The subscription of each member shall be equal to its
quota and shall be paid in full to the Fund at the appropriate
depository on or before the date when the member becomes
eligible under Article XX, Section 4(c) or (d), to buy currencies
from the Fund.
(6) Each member shall pay in gold, as a minimum, the smaller
of
  * (_i_) twenty-five percent of its quota ; or
  * (_ii_) ten percent of its net official holdings of gold and
United States dollars as at the date when the Fund notifies
members under Article XX, Section 4(a) that it will shortly
be in a position to begin exchange transactions.
Each member shall furnish to the Fund the data necessary to
determine its net official holdings of gold and United States
dollars.
  * (_c_) Each member shall pay the balance of its quota in its own
currency.
  * (_d_) If the net official holdings of gold and United States
dollars of any member as at the date referred to in (6) (ii) above
are not ascertainable because its territories have been occupied
for determining such holdings. If such date is later than
that on which the country becomes eligible under Article XX,
Section 4(c) or (d), to buy currencies from the Fund, the Fund
and the member shall agree on a provisional gold payment to
be made under (6) above, and the balance of the member s
subscription shall be paid in the member s currency, subject to
appropriate adjustment between the member and the Fund
when the net official holdings have been ascertained.
Section 4. Payments when quotas are changed
  * (_a_) Each member which consents to an increase in its quota
shall, within thirty days after the date of its consent, pay to the
Fund twenty-five percent of the increase in gold and the balance
in its own currency. If, however, on the date when the member
consents to an increase, its monetary reserves are less than its
new quota, the Fund may reduce the proportion of the increase
to be paid in gold.
(6) If a member consents to a reduction in its quota, the Fund
shall, within thirty days after the date of the consent, pay to
the member an amount equal to the reduction. The payment
shall be made in the member s currency and in such amount of
gold as may be necessary to prevent reducing the Fund s
holdings of the currency below seventy-five percent of the new
quota.
  * (_c_) A majority of eighty-five per cent of the total voting
power shall be required for any decisions dealing with the
payment, or made with the sole purpose of mitigating the effects
of the payment, of increases in quotas proposed as the result of
a general review of quotas.
Section 5. Substitution of securities for currency
The Fund shall accept from any member in place of any part
of the member s currency which in the judgment of the Fund is
not needed for its operations, notes or similar obligations issued
by the member or the depository designated by the member
under Article XIII, Section 2, which shall be non-negotiable,
non-interest bearing and payable at their par value on demand
by crediting the account of the Fund in the designated
depository. This Section shall apply not only to currency
subscribed by members but also to any currency otherwise due
to, or acquired by, the Fund.
Article IV
Par Values of Currencies
Section 1. Expression of par values
  * (_a_) The par value of the currency of each member shall be
expressed in terms of gold as a common denominator or in terms
of the United States dollar of the weight and fineness in effect
on July 1, 1944.
  * (_b_) All computations relating to currencies of members for the
purpose of applying the provisions of this Agreement shall be
on the basis of their par values.
Section 2. Gold purchases based on par values
The Fund shall prescribe a margin above and below par value

**3.** Foreign exchange dealings based on parity
The maximum and the minimum rates for exchange
between the currencies of members taking place
their territories shall not differ from parity,
  * (_i_) in the case of spot exchange transactions, by more than
one percent ; and
  * (_ii_) in the case of other exchange transactions, by a margin
which exceeds the margin for spot exchange transactions by
more than the Fund considers reasonable.
Section 4. Obligations regarding exchange stability
  * (_a_) Each member undertakes to collaborate with the Fund to
promote exchange stability, to maintain orderly exchange
arrangements with other members, and to avoid competitive
exchange alterations.
(6) Each member undertakes, through appropriate measures
consistent with this Agreement, to permit within its territories
exchange transactions between its currency and the currencies
of other members only within the limits prescribed under Section
3 of this Article. A member whose monetary authorities, for the
settlement of international transactions, in fact freely buy and
sell gold within the limits prescribed by the Fund under Section
2 of this Article shall be deemed to be fulfilling this undertaking.
Section 5. Changes in par values
  * (_a_) A member shall not propose a change in the par value of
its currency except to correct a fundamental disequilibrium.
  * (_fc_) A change in the par value of a member s currency may be
made only on the proposal of the member and only after
consultation with the Fund.
  * (_c_) When a change is proposed, the Fund shall first take into
account the changes, if any, which have already taken place in
the initial par value of the member s currency as determined
under Article XX, Section 4. If the proposed change, together
with all previous changes, whether increases or decreases,
  * (_i_) does not exceed ten percent of the initial par value, the
Fund shall raise no objection,
  * (_ii_) does not exceed a further ten percent of the initial par
value, the Fund may either concur or object, but shall
declare its attitude within seventy-two hours if the member
so requests,
  * (_iii_) is not within (i) or (ii) above, the Fund may either
concur or object, but shall be entitled to a longer period in
which to declare its attitude.
  * (_d_) Uniform changes in par values made under Section 7 of
this Article shall not be taken into account in determining
whether a proposed change falls within (i), (ii), or (iii) of (c)
above.
  * (_e_) A member may change the par value of its currency
without the concurrence of the Fund if the change does not
affect the international transactions of members of the Fund.
0) The Fund shall concur in a proposed change which is
within the terms of (c) (ii) or (c) (iii) above if it is satisfied that
the change is necessary to correct a fundamental disequilibrium.
In particular, provided it is so satisfied, it shall not object to a
proposed change because of the domestic social or political
policies of the member proposing the change.
Section 6. Effect of unauthorized changes
If a member changes the par value of its currency despite the
objection of the Fund, in cases where the Fund is entitled to
object, the member shall be ineligible to use the resources of the
Fund unless the Fund otherwise determines; and if, after the
expiration of a reasonable period, the difference between the
member and the Fund continues, the matter shall be subject to
the provisions of Article XV, Section 2(6).
Section 7. Uniform changes in par values
Notwithstanding the provisions of section 5 (6) of this Article,
the Fund by an eighty-five per cent majority of the total voting
power may make uniform proportionate changes in the par
values of the currencies of all members. The par value of a
member s currency shall, however, not be changed under this
provision if, within seventy-two hours of the Fund s action, the
member informs the Fund that it does not wish the par value of
its currency to be changed by such action.
Section 8. Maintenance of gold value of the Fund s assets
  * (_a_) The gold value of the Fund s assets shall be maintained
notwithstanding changes in the par or foreign exchange value
of the currency of any member.
(6) Whenever (i) the par value of a member s currency is
reduced, or (ii) the foreign exchange value of a member s
currency has, in the opinion of the Fund, depreciated to a
significant extent within that member s territories, the member
shall pay to the Fund within a reasonable time an amount of
its own currency equal to the reduction in the gold value of its
currency held by the Fund.
  * (_c_) Whenever the par value of a member s currency is
increased, the Fund shall return to such member within a
reasonable time an amount in its currency equal to the increase
in the gold value of its currency held by the Fund.
(c() The provisions of this section shall apply to a uniform
proportionate change in the par values of the currencies of all
members, unless at the time when such a change is made the
Fund decides otherwise by an eighty-five per cent majority of
the total voting power.
Section 9. Separate currencies within a member s territories
A member proposing a change in the par value of its currency
shall be deemed, unless it declares otherwise, to be proposing a
corresponding change in the par value of the separate currencies
of all territories in respect of which it has accepted this
Agreement under Article XX, Section 2(g). It shall, however, be
open to a member to declare that its proposal relates either to
the metropolitan currency alone, or only to one or more specified
separate currencies, or to the metropolitan currency and one or
more specified separate currencies.
Article V
Transactions with the Fund

**1.** Agencies dealing with the Fund
Each member shall deal with the Fund only through its
central bank, stabilization fund or other similar fiscal
and the Fund shall deal only with or through the same

**2.** Limitation on the Fund s operations
Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, operations
on the account of the Fund shall be limited to transactions for
the purpose of supplying a member, on the initiative of such
member, with the currency of another member in exchange for
gold or for the currency of the member desiring to make the
purchase.
Section 3. Conditions governing use of the Fund s resources
  * (_a_) A member shall be entitled to buy the currency of another
member from the Fund in exchange for its own currency subject
to the following conditions :
  * (_i_) The member desiring to purchase the currency represents
that it is presently needed for making in that currency
payments which are consistent with the provisions of this
Agreement ;
  * (_ii_) The Fund has not given notice under Article VII,
Section 3, that its holdings of the currency desired have
become scarce ;
  * (_iii_) The proposed purchase would be a gold tranche
purchase, or would not cause the Fund s holdings of the
purchasing member s currency to increase by more than
twenty-five per cent of its quota during the period of twelve
months ending on the date of the purchase or to exceed two
hundred per cent of its quota ;
  * (_iv_) The Fund has not previously declared under Section 5
of this Article, Article IV, Section 6, Article VI, Section 1,
or Article XV, Section 2(o), that the member desiring to
purchase is ineligible to use the resources of the Fund.
  * (_b_) A member shall not be entitled without the permission of
the Fund to use the Fund s resources to acquire currency to hold
against forward exchange transactions.
  * (_c_) A member s use of the resources of the Fund shall be in
accordance with the purposes of the Fund. The Fund shall
adopt policies on the use of its resources that will assist members
to solve their balance of payments problems in a manner
consistent with the purposes of the Fund and that will establish
adequate safeguards for the temporary use of its resources.
  * (_d_) A representation by a member under (a) above shall be
examined by the Fund to determine whether the proposed
purchase would be consistent with the provisions of this
Agreement and with the policies adopted under them, with the
exception that proposed gold tranche purchases shall not be
subject to challenge.
Section 4. Waiver of conditions
The Fund may in its discretion, and on terms which safeguard
its interests, waive any of the conditions prescribed in Section
3(a) of this Article, especially in the case of members with a
record of avoiding large or continuous use of the Fund s
resources. In making a waiver it shall take into consideration
periodic or exceptional requirements of the member requesting
the waiver. The Fund shall also take into consideration a
member s willingness to pledge as collateral security gold, silver,
securities, or other acceptable assets having a value sufficient in
the opinion of the Fund to protect its interests and may require
as a condition of waiver the pledge of such collateral security.

**5.** Ineligibility to use the Fund s resources
Whenever the Fund is of the opinion that any member is
the resources of the Fund in a manner contrary to the
purposes of the Fund, it shall present to the member a report
forth the views of the Fund and prescribing a suitable
time for reply. After presenting such a report to a member, the
Fund may limit the use of its resources by the member. If no
reply to the report is received from the member within the
prescribed time, or if the reply received is unsatisfactory, the
Fund may continue to limit the member s use of the Fund s
resources or may, after giving reasonable notice to the member,
declare it ineligible to use the resources of the Fund.
Section 6. Purchases of currencies from the Fund for gold
  * (_a_) Any member desiring to obtain, directly or indirectly, the
currency of another member for gold shall, provided that it can
do so with equal advantage, acquire it by the sale of gold to the
Fund.
(6) Nothing in this Section shall be deemed to preclude any
member from selling in any market gold newly produced from
mines located within its territories.
Section 7. Repurchase by a member of its currency held by the
Fund
  * (_a_) A member may repurchase from the Fund and the Fund
shall sell for gold any part of the Fund s holdings of its currency
in excess of its quota.
  * (_i_) At the end of each financial year of the Fund, a member
shall repurchase from the Fund with each type of monetary
reserve, as determined in accordance with Schedule B, part of
the Fund s holdings of its currency under the following
conditions :
  * (_i_) Each member shall use in repurchases of its own currency
from the Fund an amount of its monetary reserves equal in
value to the following changes that have occurred during
the year: one-half of any increase in the Fund s holdings
of the member s currency, plus one-half of any increase, or
minus one-half of any decrease, in the member s monetary
reserves, or, if the Fund s holdings of the member s currency
have decreased, one-half of any increase in the member s
monetary reserves minus one-half of the decrease in the
Fund s holdings of the member s currency. This rule shall
not apply when a member s monetary reserves have
decreased during the year by more than the Fund s holdings
of its currency have increased.
  * (_ii_) If after the repurchase described in (i) above (if required)
has been made, a member s holdings of another member s
currency (or of gold acquired from that member) are found
to have increased by reason of transactions in terms of that
currency with other members or persons in their territories,
the member whose holdings of such currency (or gold) have
thus increased shall use the increase to repurchase its own
currency from the Fund.
  * (_c_) None of the adjustments described in (6) above shall be
carried to a point at which
  * (_i_) the member s monetary reserves are below one hundred
and fifty per cent of its quota, or
  * (_ii_) the Fund s holdings of its currency are below seventy-
five per cent of its quota, or
  * (_iii_) the Fund s holdings of any currency required to be
used are above seventy-five per cent of the quota of the
member concerned, or
  * (_iv_) the amount repurchased exceeds twenty-five per cent
of the quota of the member concerned.
  * (_d_) The Fund by an eighty-five per cent majority of the total
power may revise the percentages in (c) (i) and (iv) above
revise and supplement the rules in paragraph l(c), (d) and
and paragraph 2(6) of Schedule B.
Section 8. Charges
  * (_a_) Any member buying the currency of another member from
the Fund in exchange for its own currency shall pay, in addition
to the parity price, a service charge uniform for all members of
not less than one-half per cent and not more than one per cent,
as determined by the Fund, provided that the Fund in its
discretion may levy a service charge of less than one-half per
cent on gold tranche purchases.
  * (_b_) The Fund may levy a reasonable handling charge on any
member buying gold from the Fund or selling gold to the Fund.
  * (_c_) The Fund shall levy charges uniform for all members
which shall be payable by any member on the average daily
balances of its currency held by the Fund in excess of its quota.
These charges shall be at the following rates :
  * (_i_) On amounts not more than twenty-five percent in excess of
the quota : no charge for the first three months ; one-half
percent per annum for the next nine months ; and thereafter
an increase in the charge of one-half percent for each
subsequent year.
  * (_ii_) On amounts more than twenty-five percent and not more
than fifty percent in excess of the quota : an additional one-
half percent for the first year ; and an additional one-half
percent for each subsequent year.
  * (_iii_) On each additional bracket of twenty-five percent in excess
of the quota : an additional one-half percent for the first
year ; and an additional one-half percent for each subsequent
year.
(cO Whenever the Fund s holdings of a member s currency are
such that the charge applicable to any bracket for any period
has reached the rate of four percent per annum, the Fund and
the member shall consider means by which the Fund s holdings
of the currency can be reduced. Thereafter, the charges shall
rise in accordance with the provisions of (c) above until they
reach five percent and failing agreement, the Fund may then
impose such charges as it deems appropriate.
  * (_e_) The rates referred to in (c) and (d) above may be changed
by a three-fourths majority of the total voting power.
(/) All charges shall be paid in gold. If, however, the member s
monetary reserves are less than one-half of its quota, it shall
pay in gold only that proportion of the charges due which such
reserves bear to one-half of its quota, and shall pay the balance
in its own currency.

**9.** Remuneration
  * (_a_) The Fund shall pay remuneration, at a rate uniform for
all members on the amount by which seventy-five per cent of a
member s quota exceeded the average of the Fund s holdings of
the member s currency, provided that no account shall be taken
of holdings in excess of seventy-five per cent of quota. The rate
shall be one and one-half per cent per annum, but the Fund in
its discretion may increase or reduce this rate, provided that a
three-fourths majority of the total voting power shall be required
for any increase above two per cent per annum or reduction
below one per cent per annum.
(6) Remuneration shall be paid in gold or a member s own
currency as determined by the Fund.
Article VI
Capital Transfers
Section 1. Use of the Fund s resources for capital transfers
  * (_a_) A member may not use the Fund s resources to meet a
large or sustained outflow of capital except as provided in
section 2 of this Article, and the Fund may request a member
to exercise controls to prevent such use of the resources of the
Fund. If, after receiving such a request, a member fails to
exercise appropriate controls, the Fund may declare the member
ineligible to use the resources of the Fund.
(6) Nothing in this Section shall be deemed
  * (_i_) to prevent the use of the resources of the Fund for
capital transactions of reasonable amount required for the
expansion of exports or in the ordinary course of trade,
banking or other business, or
  * (_ii_) to affect capital movements which are met out of a
member s own resources of gold and foreign exchange, but
members undertake that such capital movements will be in
accordance with the purposes of the Fund.
Section 2. Special provisions for capital transfers
A member shall be entitled to make gold tranche purchases to
meet capital transfers.
Section 3. Controls of capital transfers
Members may exercise such controls as are necessary to
regulate international capital movements, but no member may
exercise these controls in a manner which will restrict payments
for current transactions or which will unduly delay transfers of
funds in settlement of commitments, except as provided in
Article VII, Section 3(6), and in Article XIV, Section 2.
Article VII
Scarce Currencies
Section 1. General scarcity of currency
If the Fund finds that a general scarcity of a particular
is developing, the Fund may so inform members and
issue a report setting forth the causes of the scarcity and
recommendations designed to bring it to an end. A
of the member whose currency is involved shall
participate in the preparation of the report.
Section 2. Measures to replenish the Fund s holdings of scarce
currencies
The Fund may, if it deems such action appropriate to
replenish its holdings of any member s currency, take either or
both of the following steps :
  * (_i_) Propose to the member that, on terms and conditions
agreed between the Fund and the member, the latter lend
its currency to the Fund or that, with the approval of the
member, the Fund borrow such currency from some other
source either within or outside the territories of the member,
but no member shall be under any obligation to make such
loans to the Fund or to approve the borrowing of its
currency by the Fund from any other source,
  * (_ii_) Require the member to sell its currency to the Fund for
gold.
Section 3. Scarcity of the Fund s holdings
  * (_a_) If it becomes evident to the Fund that the demand for a
member s currency seriously threatens the Fund s ability to
supply that currency, the Fund, whether or not it has issued a
report under Section 1 of this Article, shall formally declare
such currency scarce and shall thenceforth apportion its existing
and accruing supply of the scarce currency with due regard to
the relative needs of members, the general international
economic situation and any other pertinent considerations. The
Fund shall also issue a report concerning its action.
(6) A formal declaration under (o) above shall operate as an
authorization to any member, after consultation with the Fund,
temporarily to impose limitations on the freedom of exchange
operations in the scarce currency. Subject to the provisions of
Article IV, Sections 3 and 4, the member shall have complete
jurisdiction in determining the nature of such limitations, but
they shall be no more restrictive than is necessary to limit the
demand for the scarce currency to the supply held by, or
accruing to, the member in question; and they shall be relaxed
and removed as rapidly as conditions permit.
  * (_c_) The authorization under (6) above shall expire whenever
the Fund formally declares the currency in question to be no
longer scarce.
Section 4. Administration of restrictions
Any member imposing restrictions in respect of the currency
of any other member pursuant to the provisions of Section 3(6)
of this Article shall give sympathetic consideration to any
representations by the other member regarding the administra
tion of such restrictions.
Section 5. Effect of other international agreements on restrictions
Members agree not to invoke the obligations of any
engagements entered into with other members prior to this
Agreement in such a manner as will prevent the operation of
the provisions of this Article.
this Agreement, each member undertakes the obligations set out
in this Article.
Section 2. Avoidance of restrictions on current payments
  * (_a_) Subject to the provisions of Article VII, Section 3(6), and
Article XIV, Section 2, no member shall, without the approval
of the Fund, impose restrictions on the making of payments and
transfers for current international transactions.
(6) Exchange contracts which involve the currency of any
member and which are contrary to the exchange control
regulations of that member maintained or imposed consistently
with this Agreement shall be unenforceable in the territories of
any member. In addition, members may, by mutual accord, co
operate in measures for the purpose of making the exchange
control regulations of either member more effective, provided
that such measures and regulations are consistent with this
Agreement.
Section 3. Avoidance of discriminatory currency practices
No member shall engage in, or permit any of its fiscal agencies
referred to in Article V, Section 1, to engage in, any
discriminatory currency arrangements or multiple currency
practices except as authorized under this Agreement or approved
by the Fund. If such arrangements and practices are engaged in
at the date when this Agreement enters into force the member
concerned shall consult with the Fund as to their progressive
removal unless they are maintained or imposed under Article
XIV, Section 2, in which case the provisions of Section 4 of that
Article shall apply.
Section 4. Convertibility of foreign held balances
  * (_a_) Each member shall buy balances of its currency held by
another member if the latter, in requesting the purchase,
represents
  * (_i_) that the balances to be bought have been recently
acquired as a result of current transactions ; or
  * (_ii_) that their conversion is needed for making payments
for current transactions.
The buying member shall have the option to pay either in
the currency of the member making the request or in gold.
  * (_b_) The obligation in (a) above shall not apply
  * (_i_) when the convertibility of the balances has been restricted
consistently with Section 2 of this Article, or Article VI,
Section 3; or

communication while that territory is a theater of major
or for such period thereafter as the Fund may
When such a member communicates the par value of
its currency the provisions of (d) below shall apply.
  * (_b_) The par value communicated by a member whose
metropolitan territory has not been occupied by the enemy shall
be the par value of that member s currency for the purposes of
this Agreement unless, within ninety days after the request
referred to in (a) above has been received, (i) the member notifies
the Fund that it regards the par value as unsatisfactory, or (ii)
the Fund notifies the member that in its opinion the par value

par value communicated under (a) above.
  * (_e_) If a member whose metropolitan territory has been

Section shall not be taken into account in determining whether
a proposed change falls within (i), (ii), or (iii) of Article IV,

currency of its metropolitan territory shall simultaneously
communicate a value, in terms of that currency, for each

this Article, but no member shall be required to make a
communication for the separate currency of a territory which
has been occupied by the enemy while that territory is a theater

cancellation
  * (_a_) In all its decisions with respect to the allocation and
cancellation of special drawing rights the Fund shall seek to
meet the long-term global need, as and when it arises, to
supplement existing reserve assets in such manner as will
promote the attainment of its purposes and will avoid economic
stagnation and deflation as well as excess demand and inflation
in the world.
(6) The first decision to allocate special drawing rights shall
take into account, as special considerations, a collective judgment
that there is a global need to supplement reserves, and the
attainment of a better balance of payments equilibrium, as well
as the likelihood of a better working of the adjustment process
in the future.
Section 2. Allocation and cancellation
  * (_a_) Decisions of the Fund to allocate or cancel special drawing
rights shall be made for basic periods which shall run
consecutively and shall be five years in duration. The first basic
period shall begin on the date of the first decision to allocate
special drawing rights or such later date as may be specified in
that decision. Any allocations or cancellations shall take place
at yearly intervals.
(6) The rates at which allocations are to be made shall be
expressed as percentages of quotas on the date of each decision
to allocate. The rates at which special drawing rights are to be
cancelled shall be expressed as percentages of net cumulative
allocations of special drawing rights on the date of each decision
to cancel. The percentages shall be the same for all participants.
  * (_c_) In its decision for any basic period the Fund may provide,
notwithstanding (a) and (6) above, that:
  * (_i_) the duration of the basic period shall be other than five
years; or
  * (_ii_) the allocations or cancellations shall take place at other
than yearly intervals ; or
  * (_iii_) the basis for allocations or cancellations shall be the
quotas or net cumulative allocations on dates other than
the dates of decisions to allocate or cancel.
  * (_d_) A member that becomes a participant after a basic period
starts shall receive allocations beginning with the next basic
period in which allocations are made after it becomes a
participant unless the Fund decides that the new participant
shall start to receive allocations beginning with the next
allocation after it becomes a participant. If the Fund decides
that a member that becomes a participant during a basic period
shall receive allocations during the remainder of that basic
period and the participant was not a member on the dates
established under (6) or (c) above, the Fund shall determine the
basis on which these allocations to the participant shall be made.
  * (_ii_) the participant has notified the Fund in writing prior
to the first allocation of special drawing rights under that
decision that it does not wish special drawing rights to be
allocated to it under the decision. On the request of a
participant, the Fund may decide to terminate the effect of
the notice with respect to allocations of special drawing
rights subsequent to the termination.
  * (_f_) If on the effective date of any cancellation the amount of
special drawing rights held by a participant is less than its share
of the special drawing rights that are to be cancelled, the
participant shall eliminate its negative balance as promptly as
its gross reserve position permits and shall remain in consultation
with the Fund for this purpose. Special drawing rights acquired
by the participant after the effective date of the cancellation
shall be applied against its negative balance and cancelled.
Section 3. Unexpected major developments
The Fund may change the rates or intervals of allocation or
cancellation during the rest of a basic period or change the
length of a basic period or start a new basic period, if at any
time the Fund finds it desirable to do so because of unexpected
major developments.
Section 4. Decisions on allocations and cancellations

Article shall be made by the Board of Governors on the basis of
proposals of the Managing Director concurred in by the

making a proposal for the first allocation, the Managing Director
shall satisfy himself that the provisions of section 1(6) of this
Article have been met and that there is broad support among
participants to begin allocations; he shall make a proposal for
the first allocation as soon after the establishment of the Special
Drawing Account as he is so satisfied.
  * (_c_) The Managing Director shall make proposals :
  * (_i_) not later than six months before the end of each basic
period ;
  * (_ii_) if no decision has been taken with respect to allocation
or cancellation for a basic period, whenever he is satisfied
that the provisions of (b) above have been met;
  * (_iii_) when, in accordance with section 3 of this Article, he
considers that it would be desirable to change the rate or
intervals of allocation or cancellation or change the length
of a basic period or start a new basic period ; or

Governors or the Executive Directors ;
provided that, if under (i), (iii) or (iv) above the Managing
Director ascertains that there is no proposal which he considers
to be consistent with the provisions of section 1 of this Article
above, he shall report to the Board of Governors and to the
Executive Directors.
  * (_d_) A majority of eighty-five per cent of the total voting
power shall be required for decisions under section 2(a), (b) and

use its special drawing rights :
  * (_i_) to obtain an equivalent amount of its own currency held

the other participant under section 6(a) of this Article ; prevent
or reduce a negative balance of the other participant ; offset the
effect of a failure by the other participant to fulfill the
expectation in (a) above ; or bring the holdings of special
drawing rights by both participants closer to their net cumulative
allocations.
Section 4. Obligation to provide currency

higher limit as may be agreed between a participant and the
Fund. A participant may provide currency in excess of the
obligatory limit or any agreed higher limit.
Section 5. Designation of participants to provide currency
  * (_a_) The Fund shall ensure that a participant will be able to
use its special drawing rights by designating participants to
provide currency for specified amounts of special drawing rights
for the purposes of sections 2(a) and 4 of this article. Designations
shall be made in accordance with the following general principles
supplemented by such other principles as the Fund may adopt
from time to time :
  * (_i_) A participant shall be subject to designation if its balance
of payments and gross reserve position is sufficiently strong,
but this will not preclude the possibility that a participant
with a strong reserve position will be designated even
though it has a moderate balance of payments deficit.
Participants shall be designated in such manner as will
promote over time a balanced distribution of holdings of
special drawing rights among them.
  * (_ii_) Participants shall be subject to designation in order to
promote reconstitution under section 6(a) of this Article ; to
reduce negative balances in holdings of special drawing
rights; or to offset the effect of failures to fulfill the

  * (_iii_) In designating participants the Fund normally shall
give priority to those that need to acquire special drawing
rights to meet the objectives of designation under (ii) above.
(6) In order to promote over time a balanced distribution of
holdings of special drawing rights under (a) (i) above, the Fund
shall apply the rules for designation in Schedule F or such rules
as may be adopted under (c) below.

with that participant on alternative ways of replenishment
under Article VII, section 2, may require that participant to
provide its currency for special drawing rights held in the
General Account subject to section 4 of this Article. In
replenishing with special drawing rights, the Fund shall pay

types of reserves which have increased in proportion to the
amount by which each of them has increased. The remainder
of the sum payable to the Fund shall be distributed among
all types of reserves in proportion to the member s remaining
holdings thereof.
  * (_c_) If after the repurchases required under Article V, section

proportionately in such manner that these limits will not be
exceeded.
  * (_d_) If after all the repurchases required under Article V,

Fund s holdings of its currency but such distribution shall not
exceed fifty percent of its quota.

member which has not reached agreement shall be used, so far
as possible, to redeem its currency apportioned to the members
which have made agreements with the Fund under 3 above.

accordance with 3 above, the Fund shall use the currencies of
other members apportioned to that member under 2(c) above to

members under 6 above guarantees the unrestricted use of such
currency at all times for the purchase of goods or for payment
of sums due to it or to persons in its territories. Each member so
obligated agrees to compensate other members for any loss
resulting from the difference between the par value of its
currency on the date of the decision to liquidate the Fund and

the ratios that are high.

## SCHEDULE G
RECONSTITUTION

**1.** During the first basic period the rules for reconstitution
shall be as follows :
(a)(i) A participant shall so use and reconstitute its holdings
of special drawing rights that, five years after the first
allocation and at the end of each calendar quarter thereafter,
the average of its total daily holdings of special drawing
rights over the most recent five-year period will be not less
than thirty per cent of the average of its daily net cumulative
allocation of special drawing rights over the same period.
  * (_ii_) Two years after the first allocation and at the end of
each calendar month thereafter the Fund shall make
calculations for each participant so as to ascertain whether
and to what extent the participant would need to acquire
special drawing rights between the date of the calculation
and the end of any five-year period in order to comply with
the requirement in (a)(i) above. The Fund shall adopt
regulations with respect to the bases on which these
calculations shall be made and with respect to the timing
of the designation of participants under Article XXV,
section 5(a)(ii), in order to assist them to comply with the
requirement in (a)(i) above.
  * (_iii_) The Fund shall give special notice to a participant
when the calculations under (a)(ii) above indicate that it is
unlikely that the participant will be able to comply with
the requirement in (a)(i) above unless it ceases to use special
drawing rights for the rest of the period for which the
calculation was made under (a)(ii) above.
  * (_iv_) A participant that needs to acquire special drawing
rights to fulfill this obligation shall be obligated and
entitled to obtain them, at its option for gold or currency
acceptable to the Fund, in a transaction with the Fund
conducted through the General Account. If sufficient special
drawing rights to fulfill this obligation cannot be obtained
in this way, the participant shall be obligated and entitled
to obtain them with currency convertible in fact from a
participant which the Fund shall specify.
(6) Participants shall also pay due regard to the desirability
of pursuing over time a balanced relationship between their
holdings of special drawing rights and their holdings of gold
and foreign exchange and their reserve positions in the Fund.

**2.** If a participant fails to comply with the rules for
reconstitution, the Fund shall determine whether or not the
circumstances justify suspension under Article XXIX, section
2(6).

## SCHEDULE H
TERMINATION OF PARTICIPATION

XXX, section 2(6), is to the terminating participant and
agreement on settlement between the Fund and the terminating
participant is not reached within six months of the date of
termination, the Fund shall redeem this balance of special
drawing rights in equal half-yearly installments within a
maximum of five years of the date of termination. The Fund

of the terminating participant, or (6) by obtaining special
drawing rights, in accordance with Article XXX, section 6, from
the General Account or in agreement with a participant specified
the Fund or from any other holder, and the setoff of these
drawing rights against the installment due.

be made six months after the decision to liquidate the Special
Drawing Account.

**2.** If it is decided to liquidate the Fund within six months of
the date of the decision to liquidate the Special Drawing
Account, the liquidation of the Special Drawing Account shall
not proceed until special drawing rights held in the General
Account have been distributed in accordance with the following
rule:
After the distribution made under 2(a) of Schedule E, the
Fund shall apportion its special drawing rights held in the
General Account among all members that are participants in
proportion to the amounts due to each participant after the
distribution under 2(a). To determine the amount due to each
member for the purpose of apportioning the remainder of its
holdings of each currency under 2(c) of Schedule E, the Fund
shall deduct the distribution of special drawing rights made
under this rule.

**3.** With the amounts received under 1 above, the Fund shall
redeem special drawing rights held by holders in the following
manner and order :
  * (_a_) Special drawing rights held by governments that have
terminated their participation more than six months before
the date the Board of Governors decides to liquidate the
Special Drawing Account shall be redeemed in accordance
with the terms of any agreement under Article XXX or
Schedule H.
(6) Special drawing rights held by holders that are not
participants shall be redeemed before those held by partici
pants, and shall be redeemed in proportion to the amount
held by each holder.
  * (_c_) The Fund shall determine the proportion of special
drawing rights held by each participant in relation to its net
cumulative allocation. The Fund shall first redeem special
drawing rights from the participants with the highest
proportion until this proportion is reduced to that of the
second highest proportion; the Fund shall then redeem the
special drawing rights held by these participants in accordance
with their net cumulative allocations until the proportions are
reduced to that of the third highest proportion; and this
process shall be continued until the amount available for
redemption is exhausted.

**4.** Any amount that a participant will be entitled to receive
in redemption under 3 above shall be set off against any amount
to be paid under 1 above.

**5.** During liquidation the Fund shall pay interest on the
amount of special drawing rights held by holders, and each
participant shall pay charges on the net cumulative allocation
of special drawing rights to it less the amount of any payments
made in accordance with 1 above. The rates of interest and
charges and the time of payment shall be determined by the
Fund. Payments of interest and charges shall be made in special
drawing rights to the extent possible. A participant that does
not hold sufficient special drawing rights to meet any charges
shall make the payment with gold or a currency specified by
the Fund. Special drawing rights received as charges in amounts
needed for administrative expenses shall not be used for the
payment of interest, but shall be transferred to the Fund and
shall be redeemed first and with the currencies used by the Fund
to meet its expenses.

**6.** While a participant is in default with respect to any
payment required by 1 or 5 above, no amounts shall be paid to
it in accordance with 2 or 5 above.

**7.** If after the final payments have been made to participants
each participant not in default does not hold special drawing
rights in the same proportion to its net cumulative allocation,
those participants holding a lower proportion shall purchase
from those holding a higher proportion such amounts in
accordance with arrangements made by the Fund as will make
the proportion of their holdings of special drawing rights the
same. Each participant in default shall pay to the Fund its own
currency in an amount equal to its default. The Fund shall
apportion this currency and any residual claims among
participants in proportion to the amount of special drawing
rights held by each and these special drawing rights shall be
cancelled. The Fund shall then close the books of the Special
Drawing Account and all of the Fund s liabilities arising from
the allocations of special drawing rights and the administration
of the Special Drawing Account shall cease.

**8.** Each participant whose currency is distributed to other
participants under this Schedule guarantees the unrestricted use
of such currency at all times for the purchase of goods or for
payments of sums due to it or to persons in its territories. Each
participant so obligated agrees to compensate other participants
for any loss resulting from the difference between the value at
which the Fund distributed its currency under this Schedule and
the value realized by such participants on disposal of its
currency. R.S., c. 19, First Sch. ; 1968-69, c. 26, ss. 1-13.

currency has, in the opinion of the Bank, depreciated to a
significant extent within that member s territories, the member
shall pay to the Bank within a reasonable time an additional
amount of its own currency sufficient to maintain the value, as
of the time of initial subscription, of the amount of the currency
of such member which is held by the Bank and derived from
currency originally paid in to the Bank by the member under
Article II, Section 7(i), from currency referred to in Article IV,
Section 2(b), or from any additional currency furnished under
the provisions of the present paragraph, and which has not been
by the member for gold or for the currency of any
member which is acceptable to the Bank.

currency required for the purposes of the loan cannot be raised
by the borrower on reasonable terms, provide the borrower as
part of the loan with an appropriate amount of that currency.
  * (_c_) The Bank, if the project gives rise indirectly to an increased
need for foreign exchange by the member in whose territories

the borrower as part of the loan with an appropriate amount of
gold or foreign exchange not in excess of the borrower s local
expenditure in connection with the purposes of the loan.
  * (_d_) The Bank may, in exceptional circumstances, at the
request of a member in whose territories a portion of the loan is
spent, repurchase with gold or foreign exchange a part of that
member s currency thus spent but in no case shall the part so

loan in those territories gives rise to an increased need for
foreign exchange.
Section 4. Payment provisions for direct loans
Loan contracts under Section l(a)(i) or (ii) of this Article shall
be made in accordance with the following payment provisions :
  * (_a_) The terms and conditions of interest and amortization
payments, maturity and dates of payment of each loan shall be
determined by the Bank. The Bank shall also determine the
rate and any other terms and conditions of commission to be
charged in connection with such loan.
In the case of loans made under Section l(a)(ii) of this Article
during the first ten years of the Bank s operations, this rate of
commission shall be not less than one percent per annum and
not greater than one and one-half percent per annum, and shall
be charged on the outstanding portion of any such loan. At the
end of this period of ten years, the rate of commission may be
reduced by the Bank with respect both to the outstanding
portions of loans already made and to future loans, if the
reserves accumulated by the Bank under Section 6 of this Article
and out of other earnings are considered by it sufficient to
justify a reduction. In the case of future loans the Bank shall
also have discretion to increase the rate of commission beyond
the above limit, if experience indicates that an increase is
advisable.
(6) All loan contracts shall stipulate the currency or currencies
in which payments under the contract shall be made to the

currency is loaned agrees that such payments shall be made
in some other specified currency or currencies. These
payments, subject to the provisions of Article II, Section

payments at the time the loans were made, in terms of a
currency specified for the purpose by the Bank by a three-
fourths majority of the total voting power,
  * (_ii_) In the case of loans made under Section 1 (a)(ii) of this
Article, the total amount outstanding and payable to the
Bank in any one currency shall at no time exceed the total
amount of the outstanding borrowings made by the Bank
under Section 1 (a)(ii) and payable in the same currency.
  * (_c_) If a member suffers from an acute exchange stringency, so
that the service of any loan contracted by that member or
guaranteed by it or by one of its agencies cannot be provided in
the stipulated manner, the member concerned may apply to the
Bank for a relaxation of the conditions of payment. If the Bank
is satisfied that some relaxation is in the interests of the
particular member and of the operations of the Bank and of its
members as a whole, it may take action under either, or both,
of the following paragraphs with respect to the whole, or part,
of the annual service :
  * (_i_) The Bank may, in its discretion, make arrangements
with the member concerned to accept service payments on
the loan in the member s currency for periods not to exceed
three years upon appropriate terms regarding the use of
such currency and the maintenance of its foreign exchange
value ; and for the repurchase of such currency on
appropriate terms.
  * (_ii_) The Bank may modify the terms of amortization or
extend the life of the loan, or both.
Section 5. Guarantees
  * (_a_) In guaranteeing a loan placed through the usual investment
channels, the Bank shall charge a guarantee commission payable
periodically on the amount of the loan outstanding at a rate
determined by the Bank. During the first ten years of the Bank s
operations, this rate shall be not less than one percent per
annum and not greater than one and one-half percent per
annum. At the end of this period of ten years, the rate of
commission may be reduced by the Bank with respect both to
the outstanding portions of loans already guaranteed and to
future loans if the reserves accumulated by the Bank under
Section 6 of this Article and out of other earnings are considered
by it sufficient to justify a reduction. In the case of future loans
the Bank shall also have discretion to increase the rate of
commission beyond the above limit, if experience indicates that
an increase is advisable.
(6) Guarantee commissions shall be paid directly to the Bank
by the borrower.
  * (_c_) Guarantees by the Bank shall provide that the Bank may
terminate its liability with respect to interest if, upon default
the borrower and by the guarantor, if any, the Bank offers
purchase, at par and interest accrued to a date designated in
offer, the bonds or other obligations guaranteed.
  * (_d_) The Bank shall have power to determine any other terms
and conditions of the guarantee.
Section 6. Special reserve
The amount of commissions received by the Bank under
Sections 4 and 5 of this Article shall be set aside as a special
reserve, which shall be kept available for meeting liabilities of
the Bank in accordance with Section 7 of this Article. The
special reserve shall be held in such liquid form, permitted
under this Agreement, as the Executive Directors may decide.
Section 7. Methods of meeting liabilities of the Bank in case of
defaults
In cases of default on loans made, participated in, or
guaranteed by the Bank :
  * (_d_) The Bank shall make such arrangements as may be feasible
to adjust the obligations under the loans, including arrangements
under or analogous to those provided in Section 4(c) of this
Article.
(6) The payments in discharge of the Bank s liabilities on
borrowings or guarantees under Sections l(a)(ii) and (iii) of this
Article shall be charged :
  * (_i_) first, against the special reserve provided in Section 6 of
this Article.
  * (_ii_) then, to the extent necessary and at the discretion of
the Bank, against the other reserves, surplus and capital
available to the Bank.
  * (_c_) Whenever necessary to meet contractual payments of
interest, other charges or amortization on the Bank s own
borrowings, or to meet the Bank s liabilities with respect to
similar payments on loans guaranteed by it, the Bank may call
an appropriate amount of the unpaid subscriptions of members
in accordance with Article II, Sections 5 and 7. Moreover, if it
believes that a default may be of long duration, the Bank may
call an additional amount of such unpaid subscriptions not to
exceed in any one year one percent of the total subscriptions of
the members for the following purposes :
  * (_i_) To redeem prior to maturity, or otherwise discharge its
liability on, all or part of the outstanding principal of any
loan guaranteed by it in respect of which the debtor is in
default.
  * (_ii_) To repurchase, or otherwise discharge its liability on,
all or part of its own outstanding borrowings.

Agreement, the Bank shall have the power:

purpose of facilitating their sale.

may deal with any person, partnership, association, corporation
or other legal entity in the territories of any member.
Section 9. Warning to be placed on securities
Every security guaranteed or issued by the Bank shall bear
on its face a conspicuous statement to the effect that it is not
an obligation of any government unless expressly stated on the
security.
Section 10. Political activity prohibited

affairs of any member; nor shall they be influenced in their

withdrawal, but shall remain subject to all obligations.
Section 3. Cessation of membership in International Monetary

member.
Section 4. Settlement of accounts with governments ceasing to be

liabilities to the Bank so long as any part of the loans or
guarantees contracted before it ceased to be a member are
outstanding ; but it shall cease to incur liabilities with respect
to loans and guarantees entered into thereafter by the Bank
and to share either in the income or the expenses of the Bank.
(6) At the time a government ceases to be a member, the Bank
shall arrange for the repurchase of its shares as a part of the
settlement of accounts with such government in accordance with
the provisions of (c) and (d) below. For this purpose the
repurchase price of the shares shall be the value shown by the
books of the Bank on the day the government ceases to be a
member.
  * (_c_) The payment for shares repurchased by the Bank under
this section shall be governed by the following conditions :
  * (_i_) Any amount due to the government for its shares shall
be withheld so long as the government, its central bank or
any of its agencies remains liable, as borrower or guarantor,
to the Bank and such amount may, at the option of the
Bank, be applied on any such liability as it matures. No
amount shall be withheld on account of the liability of the
government resulting from its subscription for shares under
Article II, Section 5(ii). In any event, no amount due to a
member for its shares shall be paid until six months after
the date upon which the government ceases to be a member,
  * (_ii_) Payments for shares may be made from time to time,
upon their surrender by the government, to the extent by
which the amount due as the repurchase price in (6) above
exceeds the aggregate of liabilities on loans and guarantees
in (c)(i) above until the former member has received the full
repurchase price.
  * (_iii_) Payments shall be made in the currency of the country
receiving payment or at the option of the Bank in gold,
  * (_iv_) If losses are sustained by the Bank on any guarantees,
participations in loans, or loans which were outstanding on
the date when the government ceased to be a member, and
the amount of such losses exceeds the amount of the reserve
provided against losses on the date when the government
ceased to be a member, such government shall be obligated
to repay upon demand the amount by which the repurchase
price of its shares would have been reduced, if the losses
had been taken into account when the repurchase price was
determined. In addition, the former member government
shall remain liable on any call for unpaid subscriptions
under Article II, Section 5(ii), to the extent that it would
have been required to respond if the impairment of capital
had occurred and the call had been made at the time the
repurchase price of its shares was determined.
  * (_d_) If the Bank suspends permanently its operations under
Section 5(6) of this Article, within six months of the date upon
which any government ceases to be a member, all rights of such
government shall be determined by the provisions of Section 5
of this Article.

assets of the Bank, and then out of payments to the Bank on

creditors holding direct claims, the Executive Directors shall
make such arrangements as are necessary, in their judgment, to
insure a distribution to holders of contingent claims ratably
with creditors holding direct claims.

their subscriptions to the capital stock of the Bank until
  * (_i_) all liabilities to creditors have been discharged or
provided for, and
  * (_ii_) a majority of the Governors, exercising a majority of
the total voting power, have decided to make a distribution.
  * (_f_) After a decision to make a distribution has been taken
under (e) above, the Executive Directors may by a two-thirds
majority vote make successive distributions of the assets of the
Bank to members until all of the assets have been distributed.
This distribution shall be subject to the prior settlement of all
outstanding claims of the Bank against each member.
  * (_g_) Before any distribution of assets is made, the Executive
Directors shall fix the proportionate share of each member
according to the ratio of its shareholding to the total outstanding
shares of the Bank.
  * (_h_) The Executive Directors shall value the assets to be
distributed as at the date of distribution and then proceed to
distribute in the following manner :

amount equivalent in value to its proportionate share of
the total amount to be distributed.

made under (i) above shall be paid, in its own currency,

by the Bank, up to an amount equivalent in value to such

have been made to members under (i), (ii), and (iii) above
shall be distributed pro rata among the members.
