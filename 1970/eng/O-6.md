and

immediately preceding the day on which
his application is approved, or, if he has

  * (_i_) has been present in Canada prior to
those ten years for an aggregate period
at least equal to twice the aggregate

Canada for at least one year immediately
preceding the day on which his applica
tion is approved, or
  * (_ii_) has resided in Canada after attaining
eighteen years of age and prior to the
day on which his application is approved

this Act, no pension may be paid to any
person in respect of any period prior to the
day on which his application is approved.
(3) Subject to the conditions specified in
the regulations, the Minister is entitled, for
the purpose of ascertaining the age of any
pensioner or any applicant for a pension, to
obtain from the Dominion Bureau of Statis
tics, upon request, any information respecting
the age of a pensioner or applicant that is
contained in the returns of any census taken
more than thirty years before the date of the
request. R.S., c. 200, s. 3; 1957, c. 14, s. 11,

amount of such pension shall be adjusted
annually, in such manner as may be prescribed
by regulation, so that the amount that may
be paid to such person for a month in any
year after 1967 is the product obtained by

the application was received, as may be
prescribed by regulation.
(2) Notwithstanding subsection (1), where a
person who has applied to receive a pension
attained the age of sixty-five years before the
day on which the application was received,
the approval of the application may be
effective as of such earlier day, not before the
later of
  * (_a_) a day one year before the day on which
the application was received, and
(6) the day on which the applicant attained
the age of sixty-five years,
as may be prescribed by regulation.

becoming a pensioner, has been convicted of
an offence and sentenced to a term of

ment of his pension for any period he

may be, and where the election is an election
under subsection (3) no supplement may be

application for a supplement in respect of
any year is made by a person who on the last

direction under subsection (3) with respect to
an application for a supplement in respect of

preceding year,
the Minister may approve payment to that
person of an interim supplement for a

accord with his income (hereinafter referred
to as his "shown income") calculated as
required by this Part on the basis of the

permitted by section 12 to be made or filed
by him, the following adjustments shall be
made :

income shall be deducted and retained out
of any subsequent payments of supplement
or pension made to him, in such manner as
may be prescribed ; and
(6) if his shown income exceeds his actual
income, there shall be paid to him any
amount by which the supplement that
would have been paid to him for months in
